Description: Allows access to data in running instance of Microsoft Excel
    (e. g. 'xl[a1] = xl[b2]*3' and so on). Graphics can be transferred with
    'xl[a1] = current.graphics()'. Additionally there are function for reading/writing 
    'Excel' files - 'xl.read.file'/'xl.save.file'. They are not fast but able to read/write 
    '*.xlsb'-files and password-protected files. There is an Excel workbook with 
    examples of calling R from Excel in the 'doc' folder. It tries to keep things as
    simple as possible - there are no needs in any additional
    installations besides R, only 'VBA' code in the Excel workbook.
    Microsoft Excel is required for this package.
