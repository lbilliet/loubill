\section{Changes in mctest version 1.2 (2018-02-24)}{
\itemize{
\item {A function \code{eigprop()} is added that computes the eigenvalues, condition indices and variance decomposition proportion collinearity diagnostic procedures found in Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980).}
\item {References are updated and doi are added.}
\item {The x-axis label is removed to avoid the confusion of relating regressors with eigenvalues dimensions.}
}
}

  \itemize{
  \item {References are updated.}
  \item {In \code{omcdiag()} and \code{imcdiag()} output, "COLLINEARITY in not detected by the test" is replaced by "COLLINEARITY is not detected by the test"}
  \item {In \code{omcdiag} output, "Condition Indices" is updated to "Condition Indices"}

      \item Examples related to the use of \code{all} argument are added.
      \item Help files are improved.
