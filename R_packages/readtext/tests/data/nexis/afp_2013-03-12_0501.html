</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria's main opposition National Coalition welcomed an announcement by France on Thursday that it and Britain are ready to arm rebels fighting to oust the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We consider it a step in the right direction... Assad will not accept a political solution (to the conflict) until he realises he is faced with an (armed) force that will defeat him,&quot; said Coalition spokesman Walid al-Bunni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as the Europeans and the Americans do not arm the rebels, they are telling Assad to keep fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So long as Iran and Russia continue to support him (Assad), he will remain convinced that he will win&quot; the war, the spokesman told AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of the second anniversary of the outbreak of a revolt against Assad's regime, France said it and Britain were ready to arm Syria's rebels even without unanimous support in the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Paris and London would call for moving up the date of the next EU meeting on the Syria arms embargo, and would decide to arm the rebels if the 27-member body does not give unanimous agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Paris was considering providing the rebels with ground-to-air missiles to retaliate against air strikes by government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations says at least 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's two-year conflict and another one million forced to flee the country as refugees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAMASCUS, March 14 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN urged governments on Wednesday to unlock the funds it desperately needs to assist one million refugees who have fled Syria's war, which a charity said increasingly features child soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia, meanwhile, warned that arming Syria's rebels would breach international law, after Western powers dropped hints about giving military aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned of the &quot;enormous threat&quot; to the region from the two-year conflict that has already killed at least 70,000 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appeal to parliaments, governments to approve extraordinary funds to support the Syrian victims and the countries that receive them,&quot; Guterres said in Jordan, which hosts 450,000 refugees, almost half of the total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If that does not happen, with the normal UN aid budgets we will not be able to deliver,&quot; he said, urging world powers to press for a solution or face the &quot;catastrophic scenario&quot; of the conflict spilling over borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His plea was echoed by Joel Charny, vice president of the US-based alliance of relief organisations, InterAction, who urged donors to make good on promises made at a conference in Kuwait in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far only around 20 percent of the $1.5 billion pledged has been received, according to figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeals came a day after Syria said its army was ready to fight &quot;for years&quot; and ahead of the second anniversary of the March 15, 2011 nationwide protests that triggered the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations broke out after the arrest and torture of children accused of painting anti-regime graffiti in the southern city of Daraa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years on, a British charity reported that children are being increasingly recruited on the front line, with both sides using boys as soldiers and even human shields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a growing pattern of armed groups on both sides of the conflict recruiting children under 18 as porters, guards, informers or fighters,&quot; said Save the Children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report on Tuesday, the UN children's agency said children have been recruited in a conflict it says threatens an entire generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF said nearly two million children in Syria under 18 were in dire need of aid, about 800,000 under 14 were internally displaced and that more than 500,000 children have fled the violence as refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London, meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met his British counterpart William Hague a day after Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain would consider ignoring an EU arms ban and supply weapons to the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arming the opposition is in breach of international law,&quot; Lavrov said at a news conference with Hague, British Defence Minister Philip Hammond and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western powers have stepped up non-military support for the rebels, even as Russia has continued to arm its ally Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is currently giving &quot;non-lethal&quot; support to the rebels but Hague and Hammond refused to rule out arming them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you can be assured of is that any action we take will be legal, will be clearly with a strong basis in international law,&quot; Hammond insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An opposition National Coalition spokesman, meanwhile, told AFP the opposition is to meet next Monday and Tuesday in Istanbul for delayed talks on forming an interim government and electing a prime minister for rebel-controlled areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ground, a regime air strike targeted the strife-torn district of Baba Amr in Homs after rebels infiltrated the area, and clashes raged near the tense border with Lebanon, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 12 people were killed, including several children, by mortar fire in Damascus, said the Observatory, which reported an overall death toll of at least 130, including 52 civilians, in violence on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the United Nations, diplomats said the world body has halted peacekeeping patrols in the Golan Heights amid fears that fallout from the Syrian war could lead more countries to withdraw from its force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day abduction last week of 21 Philippine members of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, which has monitored a ceasefire zone between Syria and Israel since 1974, has heightened security fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada pulled its troops out in March 2006, while Japan and Croatia withdrew their contingents in recent months, leaving only the Philippines, Austria and India in UNDOF.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">695 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NICOSIA, March 14 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After nine months of stop-start negotiations, cash-strapped Cyprus is on the verge of securing an EU bailout but analysts say it will come at a hefty price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurozone finance ministers are to meet on Friday after a two-day EU summit in Brussels, to thrash out a bailout plan for Cyprus that will hopefully conclude marathon talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The longer this has gone on, the more drastic the proposed measures have become, the craziest idea being a haircut on deposits, which would only ensure that EU taxpayers never get their money back,&quot; analyst Fiona Mullen told AFP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has dismissed any suggestion of a haircut on bank deposits to help pay for a rescue package estimated at 17 billion euros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in order to seal an agreement, the newly elected government has had to cross red lines on the island's low corporate tax rate and on the sale of profitable state utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like it will have to accept an increase in the corporate tax rate to 12.5 percent, which until now was the lowest in the eurozone at 10 percent,&quot; said Mullen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And of course privatisation used to be taboo, but they will not get a bailout without it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Cyprus may also have to accept more &quot;damaging taxes&quot;, such as the financial transaction tax, which will hit the big foreign exchange trading companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyprus requested financial assistance from the EU in June last year after its two largest banks -- Bank of Cyprus and Popular Bank -- sought state aid following massive losses estimated at &acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8218;</SPAN>&not;4.5 billion resulting from a Greek debt haircut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicosia has argued that its eagerness to support Greece and show eurozone solidarity has been its undoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the island's banks being the most exposed to Greek debt, Cyprus simply could not afford to agree a 75 percent write-down of its bond holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And because state finances had deteriorated, the government was unable to access international financial markets to assist its own banks and so applied for aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a rescue package reached last year, Greece obtained a partial reduction in debt owed to private creditors, who included Cypriot banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades has pushed for this to be taken into account in talks with international creditors on the island's own bailout, which has been earmarked for the end of March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The consequences of the haircut of Greek bonds was not handled on our side in the best possible manner within European institutions,&quot; Anastasiades told To Vima newspaper over the weekend, referring to the administration of his communist predecessor Demetris Christofias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyprus is the fifth financial rescue following those for Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and for Spanish banks, but has proved to be the most difficult to conclude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Christofias government tried to avoid the harsh terms of an EU bailout by asking Russia and China for bilateral loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the amount required soared, it became clear that the troika -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- was the only institution with the resources to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mooted 17-billion euro ($22.2 billion) bailout figure is roughly the same as the island's total economic output, and would increase debt to more than 140 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a level considered unmanageable in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The island's Simerini newspaper said Cyprus had been told to find seven billion euros of the 17 billion euros it needs because lending the government more than 10 billion would make the debt unserviceable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help fast-track an agreement, Cyprus has agreed to submit its banks to independent scrutiny to allay suspicions of money-laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concerns stem from allegations that the island is a favoured destination for the ill-gotten gains of Russian oligarchs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent audit is expected to begin next week and be completed before the end of March as requested by eurogroup finance ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the eurozone summit, Finance Minister Michalis Sarris is to fly to Moscow for talks on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the agenda will be extending a 2.5 billion euro Russian loan payment due in 2016 and discussing how Russia could contribute to the bailout package, state radio reported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal both battled through three-set thrillers Wednesday to set up a mouthwatering quarter-final at Indian Wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending champion Federer defeated fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3, 6-7 (4/7), 7-5, laboring two hours and 20 minutes to subdue his old friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadal, playing his fourth tournament since returning from a seven-month injury absence, outlasted the in-form Latvian Ernests Gulbis 4-6, 6-4, 7-5.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two of the &quot;big four&quot; of men's tennis also reached the quarter-finals of combined ATP Masters and WTA event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated American Sam Querrey 6-0, 7-6 (8/6) in a match that started after midnight and finished around 2am on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World No. 3 Andy Murray beat unseeded Argentinian Carlos Berlocq 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic's late night was the result of some long matches Wednesday on stadium court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federer had a golden opportunity to make his day much shorter, but serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set he was broken to love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to convert two break points in the following game he surrendered the set on a tiebreaker when he double-faulted on set point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wawrinka then gained the upper hand with a break in the third set, but Federer, winner of 17 Grand Slam titles, broke back and earned the decisive break in the final game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I was a little little lucky to come through it in the end,&quot; said Federer, who continued to say a sore back would not hinder his pursuit of a first title of 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overall I'm very pleased that I was able to play today and play at a high level,&quot; Federer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadal is playing his first hard court tournament since left-knee tendinitis forced him out of the Miami Masters last March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damage in the same knee later sidelined him for seven months -- from a second-round defeat at Wimbledon until a comeback swing of three clay-court tournaments in Latin America in February that yielded two titles and a runner-up finish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadal had admitted he did not know how his knee would hold up on hard courts, and in qualifier Gulbis he came up against a red-hot player who had won the Delray Beach title as a qualifier the week before Indian Wells and toppled two seeds en route to his meeting with the Spaniard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Always against Ernests it's a very difficult match,&quot; Nadal said. &quot;He's a very, very aggressive player with a big serve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadal saved the only break point he faced in the third set, and converted his only opportunity to break in the 11th game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he finally blasted a forehand winner on his third match point, Nadal gave a little leap of joy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time he played Federer was in the semi-finals at Indian Wells last year when he lost 6-3, 6-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A packed schedule on stadium court saw Nadal's match, the last of the day session, finish at at 9:47pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came Maria Sharapova's 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 victory over Italy's Sara Errani in a rematch of the French Open final won by the Russian superstar last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharapova booked a semi-final clash with Maria Kirilenko, who upset fifth-seeded Czech Petra Kvitova 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the only other women's match of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic took the court at 12:23 against Querrey, but there was no upset for the American this time as the world's top player set aside the frustration of his long wait to win in one hour and 27 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic, a two-time winner here in 2008 and 2011, next faces France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 winner over Canadian Milos Raonic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murray will take on another Argentinian, seventh-seeded Juan Martin del Potro. Del Potro cruised past German veteran Tommy Haas 6-1, 6-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych also advanced, beating France's Richard Gasquet 6-1, 7-5 to advance to a quarter-final meeting with South African Kevin Anderson -- a 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 winner over France's Gilles Simon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese-made missiles have been used to shoot down two Syrian army helicopters, state media reported Thursday, adding their performance could boost the international sales appeal of Chinese weapons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Times, a tabloid with close links to the ruling Communist Party, said a pair of videos posted on the Internet by Free Syrian Army rebels showed two Mi-8/17 helicopters being shot down by Chinese shoulder-launched missiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper said it was not known how the rebels, who have been fighting to topple the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad for the past two years, obtained the missiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it said the success of the FN-6 weapons, which it said were developed by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, could lift the overall image of China's defence products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In regards to export prospects, Chinese weapons need to engage in more conflicts to prove their value,&quot; Daniel Tong, identified as the founder of the Chinese Military Aviation website, told the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The kills are proof that the FN-6 is reliable and user-friendly, because rebel fighters are generally not well-trained in operating missile systems,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese weapons have not been tested in battle to the same extent as those built by the United States and Russia, and publicity surrounding the shootdowns will raise the profile of China's air defence products, the paper cited him as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he lamented the loss of life in the conflict and said: &quot;Any bloodshed is regrettable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Times said Chinese missiles have shot down targets in several other conflicts, though it added the Syrian conflict is the first time such a success has been recorded on video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation refused to comment on the report when contacted by AFP. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular briefing that she had not seen it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China and Russia, both members of the UN Security Council, have joined together to block resolutions that would have introduced sanctions against Assad's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said only &quot;dialogue and negotiations&quot; could end the Syrian war and that China was &quot;distressed and concerned&quot; over the &quot;bleeding and suffering&quot; of Syria's people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS, March 14 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France and Britain are ready to arm Syrian rebels even without unanimous EU support, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris and London will call for moving up the date of the next European Union meeting on the Syria arms embargo, and will decide to arm the rebels if the 27-member body does not give unanimous agreement, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fabius said the regime of President Bashar al-Assad was receiving weapons from Iran and Russia which gave it an edge over the opposition in the two-year conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France and Britain will ask &quot;the Europeans now to lift the embargo so that the resistance fighters have the possibility of defending themselves,&quot; he told France Info radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot accept the current disequilibrium with Iran and Russia supplying arms to Assad on the one hand and the opposition unable to defend itself on the other,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Paris was considering providing the rebels with ground-to-air missiles to retaliate against air strikes by government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lifting the embargo is the only means of moving things on a political level,&quot; Fabius said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If unanimous EU support for lifting the measure is lacking, the French and British governments will decide to deliver weapons, Fabius said, adding that France &quot;is a sovereign nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday said that &quot;arming the opposition is in breach of international law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Fabius rejected this saying that one could not take recourse to legal arguments to say that &quot;'we can supply arms to Assad but will not allow resistance fighters to defend themselves.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western powers have stepped up non-military support for the rebels, even as Russia has continued to arm its ally Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is currently giving &quot;non-lethal&quot; support to the rebels but its foreign and defence ministers have refused to rule out arming them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next EU meeting to study the embargo is planned for the end of May, but Fabius said Paris and London want to hold the meeting sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must move quickly,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;We along with the British will ask for the meeting to be moved up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not rule out a gathering before the end of March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister David Cameron said Tuesday that Britain would consider ignoring an EU arms ban and supplying weapons to Syrian rebels if it would help topple Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU last month amended its embargo to allow member nations to supply &quot;non-lethal&quot; equipment and training to the opposition but stopped short of lifting the embargo entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 70,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, according to the United Nations, while the number of  refugees has reached one million.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian Orthodox Church and President Vladimir Putin said Thursday they expected that newly elected Pope Francis will foster warmer ties between the Orthodox and Catholic churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Russian Church welcomes the decision of the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, and, as before, counts on relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches developing in a positive way,&quot; the head of Russian Patriarch Kirill's press service, Deacon Alexander Volkov, told the RIA Novosti news agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can only hope that he will continue the line of the previous pope and that the positive dynamic in developing relations between our churches will continue,&quot; Archpriest Dmitry Sizonenko, secretary of the Patriarch's department for external relations, told RIA Novosti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patriarch Kirill has not yet made a public statement on the Pope's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Putin, a Russian Orthodox believer, sent a telegram of congratulations saying that &quot;I am convinced that constructive cooperation between Russia and the Vatican will develop further on the basis of the Christian values that we share.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wished the new pope &quot;fruitful activity in strengthening peace and promoting dialogue between civilisations and religions,&quot; the Kremlin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archdeacon Andrei Kurayev, a reformist cleric, wrote on his blog after the announcement that the new pope &quot;promises huge shocks for the Catholic Church, forcing it to change into a church for the poor, not a church for the prosperous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised the new pope for embracing a simple, humble life: &quot;He has refused to use a limousine. He cooks for himself.. In 2001 he visited a hospice where he washed and kissed the feet of 12 people suffering from AIDS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian Orthodox Church has troubled relations with the Catholic Church dating back to Soviet times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stalin persecuted the Ukrainian Greek Catholic, or Uniate, Church, an eastern rite Catholic Church which is led by the pope, while the Orthodox Church was allowed to operate in a limited way under the control of the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian Orthodox Church is now concerned over the influence of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, which has enjoyed a revival after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The difficulties have so far ruled out a visit by the pope to Russia or a meeting between the leaders of the two churches.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria Sharapova progressed to the semi-finals at Indian Wells on Wednesday with a 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 victory over Sara Errani in a rematch of last year's French Open final.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian beat the Italian in the Roland Garros title match last year to complete a career Grand Slam and again triumphed this time round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a win over the sixth seed, Sharapova reached the semi-finals in the California desert for the sixth time and said she hoped to secure a second title to go with the one she captured back in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm giving myself an opportunity to be back in the final, and hopefully I will go farther this time,&quot; said Sharapova, who was runner-up to Victoria Azarenka last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharapova was slow out of the blocks against Errani, as she was in her 7-5, 6-0 victory over Spain's Lara Arruabarrena-Vecino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian broke her in the first game of the match as Sharapova delivered two double faults and although the Russian immediately regained the break she dropped her serve again in the seventh game with another brace of double faults to trail 4-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharapova buckled down, however, getting the break she needed to force a tiebreak in the 10th game before fending off a set point in the tiebreaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrapped up the match after two hours and one minute -- just after the clock ticked past midnight in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the semi-finals she'll face Russia's Maria Kirilenko, who beat 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirilenko, who beat third-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska in the fourth round, improved to 6-0 in three-set matches this year and reached the Indian Wells semi-finals for the first time in 10 appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining women's quarter-finals were scheduled for Thursday. Top seed Azarenka will face eighth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark and fourth seed German Angelique Kerber will take on seventh-seeded Australian Samantha Stosur.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Venezuelans, the late Hugo Chavez is deeply etched in their minds and souls. But plans for them to be able to view him in perpetuity may have gone awry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of embalming his remains specially so that he could be viewed like Lenin started too late, acting President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists from around the world and countries like Russia and Germany have been summoned and the news is not good, Maduro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government had said it wanted Chavez's supporters to be able to visit the late standard-bearer of the Latin American left forever in the wake of his March 5 death from cancer after 14 years in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason is that &quot;preparatory steps would have to have been taken much earlier,&quot; Maduro said. &quot;The decision would have to have been made much earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I have the duty to report on these steps so that everyone knows that there are difficulties that could make it impossible to do what was done with Lenin, Ho Chi Minh or Mao Zedong,&quot; Maduro added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduro said that he got the idea from his love of Chavez -- and from presidents who came from other countries and suggested the late leader be preserved for permanent viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chavez's casket has been on view for several days in Caracas, with tens of thousands of supporters filing past to bid farewell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only on Monday that Venezuela plunged into a bitter election fight to succeed Chavez, with Maduro and opposition leader Henrique Capriles facing off in a flurry of name-calling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of the late president's supporters massed outside the National Election Council as Maduro, dressed in a jacket in the colors of the Venezuelan flag, officially registered his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not Chavez, but I am his son and all of us together, the people, are Chavez,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing red berets and T-shirts emblazoned with Chavez's image, his supporters vowed loyalty to the deeply polarizing socialist revolution that the former army paratrooper championed for over a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capriles, an energetic 40-year-old state governor who lost to Chavez in October presidential elections, kept his followers off the street but warned Maduro on Sunday: &quot;I won't leave you an open path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are going to have to defeat me with votes,&quot; Capriles said in accepting the nomination of the main opposition coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Venezuelans will vote in snap April 14 elections after a brief campaign that analysts say heavily favors Maduro, who Chavez picked as his successor in his last public appearance before going to Cuba for cancer surgery in December.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">760 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING, March 14 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president of China's 1.35 billion people is a relaxed, affable contrast to his stiff predecessors -- but whether there will be an accompanying change of substance remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi Jinping's first months in power as head of the ruling Communist Party have shown a &quot;new style, but short on delivery so far&quot;, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Baptist University of Hong Kong, describing him as &quot;old wine in a new bottle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 59-year-old is the first Chinese leader to have been born after the Communists took power in 1949, and is one of the party's &quot;princelings&quot; -- the privileged offspring of those who played key roles in the revolution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi was named head of state by the rubber-stamp national parliament on Thursday. But he became China's de-facto supremo in November, when he was elevated to lead the all-powerful Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, a barrage of official propaganda has promised reforms on issues ranging from pollution to corruption, while Xi and others have made high-profile tours of poverty-stricken villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning that corruption could &quot;kill the party&quot;, Xi threatened in January to target not only lowly &quot;flies&quot; but also top-ranking &quot;tigers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An investigation by US news agency Bloomberg last year, however, found that Xi's relatives had amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, hinting at the challenge of implementing reforms that might threaten the business interests of powerful families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To underscore a commitment to economic reforms, Xi chose the southern city of Shenzhen, where China launched its modernisation drive three decades ago, for his first official visit as party leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any desire for fundamental reforms is likely to be tempered by the overriding fear that drastic change could weaken party control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi reportedly warned officials during his southern trip against letting the party unravel as the Soviet Union did, saying that Gorbachev-style reforms could undermine Communist control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rose to the top of the secretive party by serving as a compromise pick able to navigate between competing factions, including those of outgoing leader Hu Jintao and the influential former president Jiang Zemin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi has an impeccable political pedigree as the son of a revolutionary hero, and has a pop star wife, Peng Liyuan, who holds the rank of army general and starred in state broadcaster CCTV New Year's gala for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his father Xi Zhongxun, a respected Communist elder, was purged during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, and Xi himself was sent to the Chinese countryside to live and work alongside peasants, as were many educated youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi joined the Communist Party while labouring in the poor northern province of Shaanxi and in 1975 moved to Beijing to study at the prestigious Tsinghua University, earning a degree in chemical engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on to oversee some of China's most economically dynamic areas, including Fujian and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai, earning himself a reputation as a proponent of economic reforms and an effective manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He created a stir during a 2009 speech in Mexico by scoffing at &quot;foreigners with full bellies and nothing to do but criticise our affairs&quot; -- many Chinese harbour resentment against the West -- but he has unusually longstanding US links for a Chinese leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a research trip in 1985 he spent time in Iowa, deep in the farming heartland of the Midwest, and paid his host family a return visit last year, while his daughter Xi Mingze studied at Harvard under a pseudonym.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A diplomatic cable released on WikiLeaks recounted a 2007 conversation between Clark Randt, the then US ambassador to China, and Xi that revealed the future president as a big fan of US films on World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Randt that he &quot;tremendously enjoyed&quot; the 1998 Steven Spielberg war epic &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, the cable said, adding that Xi noted: &quot;Americans have a clear outlook on values and clearly demarcate between good and evil. In American movies, good usually prevails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cables described Xi as pragmatic yet ambitious, willing to tilt with the political winds to get ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said he was uncorrupted by money yet with a sense of political entitlement, feeling that fellow &quot;princelings&quot; like him &quot;deserve to rule China&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Thursday, he fulfils his destiny. But like all incoming Chinese leaders he will need to consolidate power, and whatever his personal beliefs, few expect him to stray far from the Communist template of gradually opening the economy while maintaining tight political control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabestan added: &quot;Frankly I don't see him as a reformer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON, Canada, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Chan is well on his way to defending his title after producing one of the greatest short programmes of his career at the World Figure Skating Championships on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 22-year-old Canadian was rewarded Wednesday night with a score of 98.37, the highest ever recorded for the opening round. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The twice world champion delivered a rock solid quadruple-triple jump combination and picture perfect triple Axel in a sublime performance that had the crowd at the Budweiser Gardens on its feet as he wound down his final spin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was so inspirational to be out there. I got into my last spin and there was a rush through my whole body. It was tingling,&quot; said Chan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chan struggled with shaky performances on the Grand Prix circuit last fall, raising questions about his chances to win again here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grabbing second place (91.56) was unheralded Denis Ten, of Kazakhstan, who opened with a beautiful quadruple toe-loop and delivered a flawless, yet less technically difficult, programme than Chan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada's number two, Kevin Reynolds, who scored an upset with his recent win at the Four Continents Championship, posted 85.16 points to sit third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known for his rapid rotation on his jumps, Reynolds produced two quadruple jumps -- a salchow and toe-loop, although he had to fight to hang onto the landing of the second. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten, seventh at the 2012 worlds, and Reynolds, who was 12th, both expressed surprise and excitement to be among the frontrunners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten, a descendant of the famous Korean general Min Keung Ho, said the small medal he won for his short programme result was the first world championship medal for Kazakhstan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will try to keep my mood and motivation the same for (Friday's) final,&quot; said Ten, who now works with the coach and choreographer who were behind US skating star Michelle Kwan's brilliant career. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chan was the only man among the four gold medal favourites to skate to his potential on a night when stellar performances were the exception. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a matter of luck,&quot; he said. &quot;It's how much work you put in and the confidence you have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I worked very hard the last three weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, the other contenders faltered, finishing out of the top three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is unlikely Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, (ninth with 75.94) can claw his way back in the final and grab a medal, his countryman Daisuke Takahashi (fourth with 84.67)and Spain's Javier Fernandez (seventh with 80.76) still have a shot at the podium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fernandez, who was coming off the high of winning the European title, turned his planned triple Axel into a single at huge cost, while Takahashi's quadruple jump attempt was significantly underroated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in contention is veteran Frenchman Brian Joubert in fifth with 84.17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Wednesday, Russians Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov finished atop the scoreboard with an assured performance in the pairs short programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The twice world silver medallists head into Friday's final with 75.84 points and a slim lead over Canadians Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford (73.61) and Germany's four-time world champions Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy (73.47).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, five couples, including another Russian and Canadian duo, are in podium position with just over six points separating fifth from first place.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRUSSELS, March 14 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Union leaders try Thursday to find a difficult balance between austerity policies adopted to cut debt and calls to spend more to generate growth and jobs in an economy stuck in the doldrums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are high. Italian elections last month saw a new anti-austerity party win a stunning 25 percent of the vote, a warning for austerity hardliners such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel who faces polls later in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unions aim to make the same point with protests Thursday just outside the summit's EU headquarters venue in Brussels, where huge banners proclaiming &quot;Austerity Pact, No! Solidarity Pact, Yes!&quot; have been put up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Italy has made a lot of people think,&quot; one EU official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, along with others, stressed the need for governments to get the public finances under control after years of overspending means nearly all EU members are in breach of deficit and total debt limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But austerity and belt-tightening cannot be the only response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need to implement these plans carefully and with flexibility, otherwise there is no growth,&quot; the official said. &quot;If there is no growth for 10 years then you can't pay back your debt ... there is not much room for manoeuvre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A draft of the summit conclusions says that with no upturn this year and &quot;unacceptably high levels of unemployment&quot;, it is critical to support growth &quot;as a matter of priority&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stabilising public finances must be done through &quot;growth-friendly fiscal consolidation&quot;, it adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hiding in this language is the idea that you can stretch the time (to meet deficit targets) a bit ... while those in a stronger position can increase expenditure,&quot; another EU official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders will try to establish &quot;what growth-friendly fiscal consolidation really means&quot; in practice, the official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is crucial for France after President Francois Hollande recognised Tuesday he could not cut the public deficit to the EU limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product this year, coming in instead at 3.7 percent as a weak economy exacts its toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failing to meet the target leaves France needing another year of grace from Brussels, an extension it seems likely to get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said pointedly he was &quot;sure that France would, like us, respect the rules&quot; on the public deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlighting the difference between the eurozone's two top economies, Berlin approved a draft 2014 budget with the lowest headline deficit in 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Growth and (budgetary) consolidation are not mutually exclusive but rather they reinforce each other,&quot; Schaeuble said Wednesday. &quot;The confidence that solid state finances brings is the pre-condition for sustainable growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU officials said the 27 EU leaders will also discuss Cyprus, taking the opportunity to meet its newly elected president, but not make any decisions on a planned debt bailout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That issue will be covered by a separate eurozone finance ministers meeting late Friday after the summit closes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders will also look at progress on a banking union plan agreed last year as part of efforts to bolster the euro and prevent any repeat of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is based on an already approved Single Supervisory Mechanism, plus a deposit guarantee and a winding up system for failing banks which need to be finalised by June to make further headway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second day of the summit Friday will review relations with the EU's strategic partners, in this case Russia, where ties have been strained by Russian President Vladimir Putin's clampdown on the opposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">553 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANCHESTER, United Kingdom, March 15 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manchester United defender Jonny Evans has warned his side not to give Manchester City even a glimmer of hope in the Premier League title race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Ferguson's side face Reading at Old Trafford in Saturday's late kick-off knowing second placed City can trim their rivals' lead at the top to nine points if they win at Everton earlier in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last season United let slip an eight-point lead with just six games to go, but Evans believes they have learnt from their mistakes and are determined to ensure a similar meltdown does not happen with 10 games to go this term.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the business end of the season,&quot; he said. &quot;We are in a great position in the league. We want to make sure we don't give City any sniff of getting back in and closing the gap on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an important couple of weeks. At this club you have this experience on how to deal with that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have all seen what happened last year so it is up to us to make sure that does not happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know we keep saying it but I think there will be an extra determination from us this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Evans did give City a tiny piece of good news as the centre-back admitted United have been feeling drained following their Champions League exit and FA Cup quarter-final draw with Chelsea last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United lost controversially to Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16 before surrendering a 2-0 lead to Chelsea at Old Trafford in the FA Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a couple of days off after the Chelsea game,&quot; Evans said. &quot;The manager decided to give us an extra day or so to rest so we came on Wednesday and got the legs going again but it wasn't too hard out there on the training pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, I didn't play in the Real Madrid game so I wasn't feeling physical tiredness but, on Sunday, I did feel a bit tired and a bit drained in the second half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the mental side of it drains you. There were a lot of emotions during the week and we have to try to switch off from that and prepare for the next match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what caught us out a bit against Chelsea at the weekend was we got off to a good start but the mentally-drained side really showed in the second half.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Reading caretaker boss Eamonn Dolan has denied Russian owner Anton Zingarevich will select the team for their visit to Old Trafford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club's academy director Dolan was handed the job temporarily on Monday after Brian McDermott was dismissed with the club four points from safety, prompting speculation that Zingarevich wanted to take a more hands-on role with the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The owner is trying to take the club forward,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;I've not been at a club ever where the board try and pick the team. You hear about that abroad but I genuinely don't think you hear about that in England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's asked me to pick the team. He's spoken about trying to get a result and that's genuinely all he said. Anton has spoken to me every day. It's his football club. But I will also speak to Nicky Hammond who is the director of football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite McDermott leaving the club, Dolan will still seek advice from the former manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brian is a great friend of mine,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;I've spoken to him each day and I will speak to him as a friend again before the weekend. All he has said to me so far is, 'Good luck, get a result'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All he wants is for Reading to get a result. That's our aim on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN WELLS, California, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria Kirilenko added another upset to her Indian Wells resume on Wednesday as she toppled fifth-seeded Petra Kvitova in three sets to reach the semi-finals of the combined ATP Masters and WTA event.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Kirilenko, playing her first tournament since retiring with a right shoulder injury in the first round at Doha, defeated the 2011 Wimbledon champion Kvitova 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She improved to 6-0 in three-set matches this year and reached the Indian Wells semi-finals for the first time in 10 appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She benefitted from a poor service game by Kvitova in the final game of the second set, when the Czech served four of her total 13 double faults of the match to drop the game and the set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they traded breaks in the sixth and seventh games of the third, Kvitova again double faulted on break point in the eighth to allow Kirilenko to serve for the match at 5-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirilenko fell behind 0-30, but reeled off four straight points to secure the win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just said to myself serve as hard as you can,&quot; said Kirilenko, adding that by that time she could tell Kvitova was going for broke on every shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally I reached the semi-finals!&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirilenko, who beat third-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska in the fourth round, will face either second-seeded Maria Sharapova or sixth-seeded Sara Errani, who faced off in a French Open final rematch later Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharapova swept past Errani in the title match at Roland Garros last year to complete a career Grand Slam, and beat Errani again in the first round of the season-ending WTA Championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian star, seeded second here behind defending champion Victoria Azarenka, was vying to reach a third straight semi-final this season.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN WELLS, California, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga reached the quarter-finals at Indian Wells on Wednesday with a three-set victory over Milos Raonic in a rematch of their record-breaking Olympic tussle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France's Tsonga needed one hour and 54 minutes to get past the Canadian 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, moving through when Raonic, known for his booming serve, delivered a double-fault on the first match point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two met in the first round at the London Olympics, with Tsonga winning 6-3, 3-6, 25-23 -- the third set the longest recorded in Games history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raonic's serve also deserted him at the crucial moment of the second set. Neither player had been broken, but he was unable to force a tiebreaker as he dropped his serve in the 12th game and send the match to a third set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsonga will face either World No. 1 Novak Djokovic or American Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals of the combined ATP Masters and WTA tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Querrey is the last man to beat the Serbian star -- back on October 31 at the Paris Masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then Djokovic has put together a 20-match winning streak and won a fourth career Australian Open title as well as the ATP title in Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic didn't attach much importance to the loss to Querrey, noting that the indoor surface was very different from the conditions they would encounter on the hard courts of the California desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Different circumstances and conditions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending champion and second seed Roger Federer takes on fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka for a quarter-final berth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federer, a four-time winner of the Indian Wells title, is bidding for his first title of 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federer is projected to face old foe Rafael Nadal in what would be a tasty quarter-final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadal is seeded fifth as he plays his fourth tournament since returning from a seven-month injury absence and faced a potentially tricky fourth-round match against qualifier Ernests Gulbis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 24-year-old Latvian is on a hot streak. He became the first qualifier to win an ATP title this year when he triumphed at Delray Beach prior to Indian Wells. Since he came through qualifying here his seeded victims have included No. 9 Janko Tipsarevic and No. 20 Andreas Seppi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World No. 3 Andy Murray faces unseeded Argentinian Carlos Berlocq, with the winner advancing to meet either seventh-seeded Juan Martin del Potro or German veteran Tommy Haas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's Kevin Anderson was the first man to punch his quarter-final ticket, with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 victory over 13th-seeded Frenchman Gilles Simon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson, who had surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow in January, was one of three unseeded players remaining in the fourth round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the quarter-finals, he'll face either sixth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych or 10th-seeded Richard Gasquet of France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two women's quarter-finals were on tap, including a rematch of last year's French Open final between Maria Sharapova and Sara Errani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Sharapova defeated the Italian at Roland Garros to complete a career Grand Slam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, the fifth seed, faced Russian Maria Kirilenko for a semi-final spot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russians Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov were last out of the gate but first in the standings with an assured performance in the pairs short programme to open the ISU World Figure Skating Championships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Volosozhar and Trankov, twice world silver medallists, will not be resting on these laurels heading into Friday's final with five couples in podium position and just over six points separating fifth from first place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russians posted a score of 75.84 ahead of Canadians Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford (73.61) who had a stellar showing that brought the crowd to its feet on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both couples hold a slim advantage over Germany's four-time world champions Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy (73.47) who delivered the least convincing performance among the top five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russians, in only their third season together, wowed the crowd with a sky-high triple twist lift to open but her landing on their triple salchow jumps was scratchy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We keep working, dance to our music and skate good. We like to send good emotion to the audience and we feel it back. And we didn't fall this year,&quot; said Trankov, of their performance set to the Love Theme from the film &quot;The Godfather.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got a season's best and we knew we could have one. We noted that the judges were not holding back with their marks and everybody got a good score.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duhamel reacted with unbridled joy when she and partner Eric Radford finished their superb La Boheme programme which featured difficult individual triple lutz jumps, the only ones in the pairs competition. As the Canadian champions waited for their scores in the kiss-n-cry, Duhamel said, &quot;I felt so amazing. It was so fun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite that, she also reported feeling sick to her stomach the entire programme, sensing a tightening in her gut ahead of each major programme element which they executed flawlessly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Szolkowy was not impressed by the judges' assessment of their performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The points said season's best, but it was not the best skating for us,&quot; he said, noting their individual jumps had unsteady landings and the spin lacked unison while overall they lacked speed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our main goal is next year in Sochi (to win the Olympics).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fourth are a second Russian team, Yuko Kavaguti and Alexander Smirnov with 69.98 points, a fraction ahead of the second Canadian pair Kirsten Moore-Towers and Dylan Moscovitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At these pre-Olympic championships, competitors are looking to stake early claims to the 2014 Olympic podium and, in the process, help to earn their countries the maximum entries possible for the Sochi Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian and the Russian pairs are now in perfect position to earn the maximum three berths in pairs for their countries. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World No. 1 and top seed Novak Djokovic faced American Sam Querrey -- the last man to beat the Serbian star back on October 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then Djokovic has put together a 20-match winning streak and won a fourth career Australian Open title as well as the ATP title in Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic didn't attach much importance to the fact that Querrey beat him in his opening match at the Paris Masters last year, noting that the indoor surface was very different from the conditions they would encounter on the hard courts of the California desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I won four, times against him,&quot; said Djokovic, who indeed leads their head-to-head 4-1. &quot;Yes, he has won the last encounter indoors -- different circumstances and conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, we'll play in front of his crowd and he has a big serve and big game and he can come up with the goods when needed,&quot; Djokovic added, noting that against such a dangerous server he couldn't afford to start as slowly as he did in a 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 third-round victory over Belgian Grigor Dimitrov.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending champion and second seed Roger Federer will battle fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka for a quarter-final spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federer, a four-time winner of the Indian Wells title, is bidding for his first tournament win of 2013 having been denied in Rotterdam and Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World No. 3 Andy Murray faces unseeded Argentinian Carlos Berlocq while Rafael Nadal, ranked fifth in the world as he continues his return from a seven-month injury absence faces a potentially tricky fourth-round match against qualifier Ernests Gulbis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 24-year-old Latvian is on a hot streak. He became the first qualifier to win an ATP title this year when he triumphed at Delray Beach prior to Indian Wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadal, whose comeback tour of three Latin American clay court tournaments saw him reach one final and win two titles, has played just one match this week. After a first round bye he beat American Ryan Harrison, then advanced on a walkover when Leonardo Mayer withdrew from their third-round match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other fourth-round matches include eighth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France against Canadian Milos Raonic in a rematch of their record-breaking first-round clash at the London Olympics, which Tsonga won 6-3, 3-6, 25-23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two women's quarter-finals were due on court, including a rematch of last year's French Open final between Maria Sharapova and Sara Errani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Sharapova defeated the Italian at Roland Garros to complete a career Grand Slam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, the fifth seed, faced Russian Maria Kirilenko for a semi-final spot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAMASCUS, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN urged governments on Wednesday to unlock the funds it desperately needs to assist one million refugees who have fled Syria's war, which a charity said increasingly features child soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia, meanwhile, warned that arming Syria's rebels would breach international law, after Western powers dropped hints about giving military aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned of the &quot;enormous threat&quot; to the region from the two-year conflict that has already killed at least 70,000 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appeal to parliaments, governments to approve extraordinary funds to support the Syrian victims and the countries that receive them,&quot; Guterres said in Jordan, which hosts 450,000 refugees, almost half of the total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If that does not happen, with the normal UN aid budgets we will not be able to deliver,&quot; he said, urging world powers to press for a solution or face the &quot;catastrophic scenario&quot; of the conflict spilling over borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His plea was echoed by Joel Charny, vice president of the US-based alliance of relief organisations, InterAction, who urged donors to make good on promises made at a conference in Kuwait in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far only around 20 percent of the $1.5 billion pledged has been received, according to figures from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeals came a day after Syria said its army was ready to fight &quot;for years&quot; and ahead of the second anniversary of the March 15, 2011 nationwide protests that triggered the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations broke out after the arrest and torture of children accused of painting anti-regime graffiti in the southern city of Daraa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years on, a British charity reported that children are being increasingly recruited on the front line, with both sides using boys as soldiers and even human shields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a growing pattern of armed groups on both sides of the conflict recruiting children under 18 as porters, guards, informers or fighters,&quot; said Save the Children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report on Tuesday, the UN children's agency said children have been recruited in a conflict it says threatens an entire generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF said nearly two million children in Syria under 18 were in dire need of aid, about 800,000 under 14 were internally displaced and that more than 500,000 children have fled the violence as refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London, meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met his British counterpart William Hague a day after Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain would consider ignoring an EU arms ban and supply weapons to the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arming the opposition is in breach of international law,&quot; Lavrov said at a news conference with Hague, British Defence Minister Philip Hammond and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western powers have stepped up non-military support for the rebels, even as Russia has continued to arm its ally Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is currently giving &quot;non-lethal&quot; support to the rebels but Hague and Hammond refused to rule out arming them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you can be assured of is that any action we take will be legal, will be clearly with a strong basis in international law,&quot; Hammond insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An opposition National Coalition spokesman, meanwhile, told AFP the opposition is to meet next Monday and Tuesday in Istanbul for delayed talks on forming an interim government and electing a prime minister for rebel-controlled areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ground, a regime air strike targeted the strife-torn district of Baba Amr in Homs after rebels infiltrated the area, and clashes raged near the tense border with Lebanon, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 12 people were killed, including several children, by mortar fire in Damascus, said the Observatory, which reported an overall death toll of at least 130, including 52 civilians, in violence on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the United Nations, diplomats said the world body has halted peacekeeping patrols in the Golan Heights amid fears that fallout from the Syrian war could lead more countries to withdraw from its force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day abduction last week of 21 Philippine members of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, which has monitored a ceasefire zone between Syria and Israel since 1974, has heightened security fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada, Japan and Croatia have withdrawn their contingents in recent months, leaving only the Philippines, Austria and India in UNDOF.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Wednesday that arming Syrian rebels would breach international law, after Western powers dropped growing hints about giving military aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in London after talks with his British counterpart William Hague, Lavrov also reiterated that it should be left to Syrians to decide the future of President Bashar al-Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavrov's comments came a day after Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain would consider ignoring a European Union arms ban and supplying weapons to Syrian rebels if necessary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arming the opposition is in breach of international law,&quot; Lavrov said at a joint press conference with Hague, British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;International law does not allow, does not permit supplies of arms to non-governmental actors and in our point of view it is a violation of international law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavrov rejected any chance of Moscow urging Assad to step aside to end the two-year-old conflict, which the United Nations says has claimed 70,000 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the destiny of Bashar al-Assad should be decided by the Syrians themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the conflict in Syria worsening, Western powers have stepped up non-military support for Syria's rebels, even as Russia has continued to arm its ally Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is currently giving &quot;non-lethal&quot; support to the rebels but Hague and Hammond refused to rule out the possibility of arming them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've never ruled out anything in the future -- we don't know how grave the situation will become,&quot; Hague told the press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammond meanwhile said that Britain would &quot;keep the situation under constant review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you can be assured of is that any action we take will be legal, will be clearly with a strong basis in international law,&quot; he insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU last month amended its embargo to allow member nations to supply non-lethal equipment including armoured vehicles to the opposition, as well as training, but stopped short of lifting the embargo entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron however told lawmakers on Tuesday that Britain &quot;might have to do things in our own way&quot; if the EU would not arm the rebels when Britain thought it necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on Monday also suggested the bloc may need to rethink its strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lavrov warned of the danger that arms supplied to Syrian rebels could one day end up in the wrong hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The process of the Arab Spring is not over yet. We don't know who is going to receive the arms and how those people are going to use it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia and China have vetoed UN Security Council sanctions against Assad's regime, but Hague insisted that there was common ground between London and Moscow on how to end the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hague said they &quot;didn't reach any specific agreement&quot; but that &quot;we found enough common ground on our concerns and our objectives to continue our efforts to reach for agreement on these matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavrov urged the Syrian opposition to appoint negotiators to talk to Assad's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that those who work with the opposition will call on the opposition to form a group of interlocutors or negotiators,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that while political transition in Syria was &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;, there should be no precondition for Assad to stand down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who say it (Assad's departure) is necessary... to start the political process, probably those people believe the task is more important than saving lives,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British-Russian talks were the first of what are hoped to be annual meetings on security, defence and foreign policy as part of a thawing of ties once frozen by the murder of dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said the next talks would be in Moscow next year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has put his weight behind wrestling's bid to remain in the Olympic programme after the ancient sport was nominated for exclusion from the 2020 Games.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin, who is a judo black belt and known for his love of wrestling and martial arts, said he would look to discuss the issue with the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exclusion of traditional sports, which were primordial in the Olympic programme since the times of ancient Greece, seems to be unjustified,&quot; Ria-Novosti news agency quoted Putin as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This question demands a separate discussion, which, I hope, we will be able to hold with our friends in the IOC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrestling had been selected to disappear from the Games in 2020, to be replaced by an as yet unidentified sport, by the 15-member IOC Executive Board at their meeting on February 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ommission of one of the most elementary Olympic sports has caused a wave of protest both from inside and outside wrestling circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month 1996 Atlanta Games Olympic champion and current Bulgarian wrestling federation president Valentin Iordanov announced his decision to return his gold medal in protest at the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His move was then replicated by Russian freestyle wrestling Synday Olympic champion Sagid Murtazaliev.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Putin, like everyone, is following the investigation, but the investigation of an attack on a person is not the president's prerogative, it is the prerogative of law enforcement authorities,&quot; his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police detained Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko last week along with the suspected getaway driver and the perpetrator of the attack on Sergei Filin, which caused facial disfigurement and serious eye damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dmitrichenko admitted in court that he had asked the perpetrator to beat up Filin but said he had never intended the use of the sulphuric acid that the attacker flung in Filin's face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filin has undergone numerous operations and is currently being treated in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will stay in Germany for a further two months for &quot;conservative treatment&quot;, a Russian medical source told the Interfax news agency, saying that he is not scheduled for any more operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatre's  workers -- including dancers, choir and orchestra members and stage crew -- said in a letter to Putin and the government published online on Tuesday that Dmitrichenko's confession seemed forced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For everyone who knows Dmitrichenko, the very idea that he could have thought of and ordered this crime -- committed in such a brutal manner -- is absurd,&quot; said a copy of the letter published on the website of Moscow Echo radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However police dismissed the letter on Wednesday, saying they were confident they had a solid case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are convinced that those detained in the case were involved in this crime,&quot; Maxim Vanichkin, a senior police official, told the ITAR-TASS news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During our probe, we did not identify a single inconsistency in the evidence they gave.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday teamed up with American action movie actor Steven Seagal to promote the Soviet-style regime of rigorous physical training for Russian schoolchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanied by the black-clad star of &quot;Under Siege&quot; and &quot;Above the Law&quot;, Putin, himself an avid sportsman, toured a newly-built complex at a prominent sambo martial arts training centre in Moscow.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After attending several training sessions, the Russian strongman said too many Russian children were sickly, noting they should take up sports to be able to defend themselves -- and the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should not have any children who, as they say, sit on the bench during physical education classes. Everyone should practise sports, everyone without exception,&quot; Putin said at the Sambo-70 sports complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sambo, a mixture of judo and wrestling, was the official in-house martial art of the KGB security services which Putin practised before switching to judo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that two-thirds of Russian teenagers suffered from chronic illnesses by the age of 14, Putin called on the government to reintroduce the Soviet-era national fitness programme that used to be known by its abbreviation GTO, or Ready for Labour and Defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children should become strong, they should be healthy, love sports and have an opportunity to practise them, should know how to defend themselves, their loved ones, their family,&quot; Putin said in remarks released by the Kremlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ultimately, they should be able to defend their motherland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian reporters that the Russian president and Seagal have been friends &quot;for a long time&quot; and regularly meet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, the two men had breakfast at Putin's residence outside Moscow, Peskov was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Putin, then the country's prime minister, visited a championship match of ultimate fighting in the company of Hollywood star Jean-Claude Van Damme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia is 85 percent finished with preparations for the Olympic Games in Sochi next year, a top official said Wednesday as the International Olympic Committee concluded their latest check-up following this winter's test events.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After evaluating the organisational and construction work that has been finished, I would say we have completed that journey by at least 85 percent,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said Wednesday at a press conference in Sochi broadcast on a live webcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IOC completed their latest evaluation of Olympic preparations ahead of Russia's hosting of the 2014 winter games in and around its southern Black Sea resort Sochi in the Krasnodar region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past two months, Sochi's venues hosted 42 test events in various winter sport disciplines, which were attended by 50,000 fans, said the IOC's Jean-Claude Killy who headed the mission to Sochi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletes gave &quot;mostly positive&quot; reaction to these sports events, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main thing is that the (Sochi) Organising Committee is learning its lessons from the test events,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;much remains to be done&quot; in the spheres of accommodation, logistics and transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Olympic preparations have been criticised for environmental damage, unfair treatment of migrant construction workers and local residents, and most of all for unprecedented costs of redeveloping Sochi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IOC however has always given top marks for preparation works through the years leading up to the games. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am sure that the games will be innovative and will go down in history,&quot; said Killy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of all infrastructure built in Sochi ahead of the Olympic Games -- including massive road, rail and other projects -- has been estimated by the government at 1.5 trillion rubles ($50 billion).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRUSSELS, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Union leaders meet Thursday and Friday with another eurozone debt bailout, this time for Cyprus, looming on the horizon as Europe's faltering economy and soaring unemployment stoke unease at stinging austerity policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Wednesday that he and his eurozone colleagues would meet after the EU summit late Friday to work on a bailout plan for Cyprus -- following previous rescues for Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and for Spanish banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyprus government spokesman Christos Stylianides said just-elected President Nicos Anastasiades hoped &quot;to create a positive climate&quot; at the summit in Brussels. A final deal on a bailout is expected later this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been much debate over a compulsory reduction, or haircut, on deposits in local banks to cut the overall cost of the rescue but Nicosia says this would be catastrophic, not only for Cyprus but for the entire 17-nation bloc, and the idea seems to be losing ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is difficult but there is no reason for panic,&quot; said Stylianides, adding there would be no haircut and no further cuts in public sector pensions and salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Patience is required and you will see that hard work brings good results,&quot; Anastasiades said as he left for Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mooted 17-billion euro ($22.2 billion) bailout is roughly the same as the island's annual economic output and would increase debt to more than 140 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a level considered unsustainable in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU officials said the 27 EU leaders will discuss Cyprus, taking the opportunity to meet its newly elected president, but not make any decisions at their summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their focus rather will be on finding how to ensure a better balance between the need for austerity and spending more money to generate growth and badly-needed jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italian elections in February saw a new anti-austerity party win a stunning 25 percent of the vote, a warning for hardliners such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel who faces polls later in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders may get the message directly on Thursday when unions from across Europe plan an &quot;anti-austerity&quot; protest near the summit's EU headquarters venue in Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A draft of the summit conclusions says that with no growth expected this year and &quot;unacceptably high levels of unemployment&quot;, it is critical to support growth &quot;as a matter of priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Member states must continue to make progress on stabilising their strained public finances but this should be done through &quot;growth-friendly fiscal consolidation,&quot; the draft adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hiding in this language is the idea that you can stretch the time (to meet deficit targets) a bit ... while those in a stronger position can increase expenditure,&quot; an EU official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders will try to establish &quot;what growth-friendly fiscal consolidation really means&quot; in practice, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another EU official stressed the need to get the balance right, warning: &quot;If there is no growth for 10 years then you can't pay back your debt so it is a narrow path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Francois Hollande notably conceded Tuesday that France would not be able to cut its public deficit to the EU limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product this year, coming in instead at 3.7 percent of GDP as a weak economy exacts its toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Finance Minister Wolgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday he was &quot;sure that France would, like us, respect the rules&quot; on the public deficit, after his ministry announced that the German structural federal budget would be balanced in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have full confidence in France and the European Commission,&quot; Schaeuble said, adding: &quot;We don't need to give each other mutual advice in public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlighting the difference between the eurozone's two top economies, Berlin approved Wednesday a draft 2014 budget with the lowest headline deficit in 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders will also look at progress on a banking union based on an already agreed Single Supervisory Mechanism, plus a deposit guarantee and bank winding up system which need to be finalised by June to make further headway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, they will review relations with the EU's strategic partners, in this case Russia, with whom relations have been strained by Russian President Vladimir Putin's clampdown on the opposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's foreign and defence ministers visited Britain for high-level talks on Wednesday in a further thawing of ties once frozen by the murder of dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met with their British counterparts William Hague and Philip Hammond for the first of what are hoped to be annual talks on security, defence and foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's Foreign Office said the new dialogue was &quot;an important milestone&quot; in British-Russian relations, showing the &quot;extent of progress in developing a mature relationship at a senior level&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian ambassador to London, Alexander Yakovenko, said it was &quot;another step in the right direction for the relationship between our two nations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ties between Britain and Russia were severely strained by the 2006 death by radioactive poisoning of former Russian spy turned dissident Litvinenko in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British police have said their chief suspect is Andrei Lugovoi, a former Russian agent who is now a lawmaker, but Moscow has refused to extradite him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations have warmed in recent years, however, with Prime Minister David Cameron visiting Moscow in 2011 and President Vladimir Putin making his first trip to London for seven years last August for the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two leaders disagree on their approach to the Syrian crisis, with Britain frustrated at Russia's refusal to back calls for President Bashar al-Assad to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both sides appear keen to build bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Russia is open for cooperation with all those who wish it. This undoubtedly applies to the United Kingdom,&quot; ambassador Yakovenko wrote in an article for British website Politics Home on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past our bilateral relations have become hostage to ill-conceived suspicions and prejudices. Fortunately, the last two years have seen ice melting, slowly but gradually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British and Russian ministers were due to give a joint press conference on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.ON, Germany's biggest power supplier, said Wednesday it returned to profit in 2012, when it booked net profit of 2.217 billion euros ($2.9 billion) compared with a loss of 2.219 billion euros a year earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlying net profit, which was adjusted for one-off effects, soared by 67 percent to 4.187 billion euros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between the two net profit figures reflected 1.7 billion euros in writedowns &quot;necessitated by the general deterioration of our market environment and by instances of regulatory and above all fiscal intervention in our business in Europe,&quot; explained chief financial officer Markus Schenck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating profit, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) climbed by 16 percent to 10.786 billion euros on a 17-percent increase in revenues to 132.09 billion euros, E.ON said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said it would raise the dividend payout to shareholders to 1.10 euros per share for 2012 from 1.00 euros a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our solid 2012 results are gratifying but, in view of our extremely difficult market environment, aren't a reason for us to sit back and relax,&quot; said chief executive Johannes Teyssen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the next few years things certainly won't be getting any easier for E.ON or, for that matter, for any other European energy supplier. Power and gas demand in our core markets still hasn&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]t recovered from the impact of the economic and financial crisis,&quot; Teyssen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the main reasons for last year's rise in underlying earnings was a significant improvement in the gas wholesale business following the renegotiation of gas-procurement contracts with producers, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, 2011 earnings had been adversely affected by one-off items relating to Germany's accelerated phaseout of nuclear energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional generating capacity in Russia and the cost-cutting measures &quot;were also positive factors,&quot; while negative factors included lower prices and sale volume in the power business, E.ON continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking ahead to the current year, E.ON said it expects to achieve EBITDA of 9.2-9.8 billion euros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This forecast factors in the loss of earnings streams through asset sales under our ongoing divestment programme,&quot; it noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlying net profit was projected to come in at 2.2-2.6 billion euros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our business environment in 2013 is very difficult,&quot; warned finance chief Schenck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is marked by the difficult business environment in the energy business, interventionist regulations, weak prices in Europe's generation markets, and pressure on gas margins,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.ON announced separately that Teyssen's contract as CEO had been extended for a further five years until the end of 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Frankfurt stock exchange, E.ON shares were up more or less in line with the market, adding 0.08 percent in early afternoon trading.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State overspending on the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics amounts to more than half a billion dollars while the government has failed to provide a lasting legacy for sporting venues, according to an official audit report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's federal audit office gave a damning verdict on preparations for the Sochi Games, as well as plans for dealing with the giant venues once the Olympics are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report presented to the Russian parliament, the Audit Chamber said cost overruns were the fault of state corporation Olympstroi, whose officials &quot;created preconditions for unnecessary increase of construction cost for sports venues,&quot; which amounted to 15.5 billion rubles ($505 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has said that total cost of the Olympic sports venues for the Sochi games will amount to 200 billion rubles ($6.5 billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audit office's examination of &quot;Olympic construction shows that their cost continues to progressively increase,&quot; said the report, adding that many investors have approached the government in 2012 asking for more money to complete their Olympic projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, presented last week but made available on the website of Russian State Duma lower house Wednesday, said Olympstroi had taken &quot;decisions which increased cost of objects without giving reasons for new calculations.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, Olympstroi confirmed cost estimates that exceeded maximum allowed financing, it said, and several venues were never approved by the state construction watchdog as required by law, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cost of all infrastructure built in Sochi ahead of the Olympic Games -- including massive road, rail and other projects -- was last estimated at 1.5 trillion rubles ($50 billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has claimed that most expenses were covered by private investors and that infrastructure was needed in Sochi, a city on the Black Sea and a major tourist destination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However most private investors have seized attractive government loans for their Sochi projects and many are planning to give the finished venues to the government as a gift after the Games having deemed them a loss-making venture due to the cost of upkeep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Audit Chamber also noted the lack of any plan for future usage of Sochi's sports infrastructure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem of effective use of Olympic heritage objects is one of the most important and must be solved immediately,&quot; the report said, noting that no program for future venue usage had yet been agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia is due to host a leg of the F1 series from 2014 to 2020 in Sochi Olympic park, and some World Cup matches in 2018. Other plans for the area included building an amusement park, and transporting stadiums to other cities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong majority of Russians are hostile to homosexuals while only four percent say they take a positive view, a public opinion poll showed Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll on attitudes to gay people by Levada independent polling agency comes as Russia's parliament is considering a bill banning &quot;propaganda of homosexuality&quot; among minors, which critics said could be used to ban any Gay Pride events.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey showed that 27 percent of Russians view homosexuals with &quot;disgust or fear,&quot; while 23 said they were &quot;irritated&quot; and 18 percent said they were &quot;wary&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only four percent said they had positive feelings towards gay people, while 23 percent said they had &quot;no particular feelings&quot; towards them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll also indicated strong backing for a ban on Gay Pride events, with 62 percent saying they were &quot;definitely opposed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian lower house in January gave initial backing to a bill banning homosexual propaganda among minors. The measure, which has been criticised by rights groups and Western government, is already being implemented in several cities including Russia's second largest, Saint Petersburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second key reading of the bill is expected in May. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Levada poll was carried out last month among 1,800 people in 45 regions of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While homosexuality was decriminalised in Russia in 1993 and removed from the list of psychiatric disorders in 1999, the poll shows that 34 percent of Russians still view homosexuality as as &quot;an illness that should be treated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll found that 35 percent of Russians think gay people &quot;definitely do not&quot; have the right to consensual relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russians also rejected the concept of legislation to allow gay couples to marry or to have the right to adopt children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty-two percent said they were &quot;firmly opposed&quot; to gay marriage, and the same number said they &quot;absolutely&quot; did not agree that gay couples should have the right to adopt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nomination by President Vladimir Putin of a close ally to head the Russian central bank puts its independence at risk and may make it more inclined to heed political pressure for looser monetary policy, economists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elvira Nabiullina, 49, currently an economic advisor to Putin and whose appointment still needs rubber-stamping by parliament, is a respected economist with years of experience in government ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she has a reputation as a close ally of Putin who is unlikely to stand up to the Russian strongman at a time when the Bank of Russia is engaging in the tricky balancing act of trying to keep resurgent inflation in check while not braking growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current incumbent Sergei Ignatyev, who is stepping down this summer after holding the post since 2002, has resisted political pressure to cut the main interest rate which stands at 8.25 percent with inflation over 7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists said her choice was a compromise between a continuity candidate like deputy central bank chief Alexei Ulyukayev and a more radical pro-growth choice like VTB state bank chief Andrei Kostin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision &quot;is a blow to hopes for a more independent monetary policy over the coming years but is unlikely to lead to major changes in the current framework,&quot; said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Policy is likely to be looser than would otherwise have been the case, but even large interest rate cuts are unlikely to do much to stimulate a flagging economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, said the market would see the appointment as &quot;open political pressure&quot; on the bank given Nabiullina&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s close association with Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could also be interpreted more broadly as further consolidation of Putin&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s power over key institutions in the country,&quot; he said in emailed comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But few cast doubt on the qualifications of Nabiullina, who was born in the Muslim region of Bashkortostan before receiving her academic training in Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal economist Konstantin Sonin, vice rector of the New Economic School, wrote on his blog that Nabiullina was a &quot;good choice&quot; largely because she would be ready to listen to different points of view on monetary policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">           -- 'Vulnerable to Putin pressure' -- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nabiullina began her career in high office when Putin became president in 2000, working as deputy economic development minister under her mentor German Gref, now head of Russia&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s biggest bank Sberbank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She became economy minister in 2007 when Gref stepped down, a post she held before moving to the Kremlin after Putin&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s 2012 presidential election victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One half of one of Russia's most powerful couples, Nabiullina is married to Yaroslav Kuzminov, the rector of the Moscow Higher School of Economics which has liberal inclinations but closely advised Putin on reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her appointment will make her not only one of the most powerful women in Russian public life but also one of the few figures of Muslim origin to hold a top federal post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s leading economic policymakers queued up Wednesday to shower praise on Nabiullina, including former finance minister Alexei Kudrin, the fiscal hawk who is the hero of liberal economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulyukayev, who many saw as the market's preferred choice, was more circumspect, saying curtly he hoped to see &quot;continuity&quot; in monetary policy after her appointment, the state RIA Novosti news agency reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading business daily Vedomosti quoted acquaintances of Nabiulluna as saying she was a tough administrator who had shown no fear in annoying ministers as she oversaw implementation of Putin&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it said one of her negative qualities was seen as a &quot;capacity to change her position under pressure from Putin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kostin, part of a camp of bankers urging looser monetary policy, said he was sure that under her tenure &quot;the central bank&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s policy would be more balanced and suited to the current tasks of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander Kliment of the Eurasia Group research group described the nomination as a &quot;compromise&quot; between the demands of the market which wants a tight anti-inflationary monetary policy and the pressure from the political elite for lower rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is an accomplished economist, but her skills as a politician operator are less clear,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 22-page micro-book, entitled &quot;Shiki no Kusabana&quot; (flowers of seasons), contains names and monochrome illustrations of Japanese flowers such as the cherry and the plum, it said, adding the 0.75 millimetre (0.03 inch) pages were impossible to read with the naked eye.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book is on display at Toppan's Printing Museum in Tokyo, and is on sale, together with a magnifying glass and a larger copy, for 29,400 yen ($307).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurozone finance ministers are to meet on Friday after a two-day summit of EU leaders in Brussels, to work on a bailout plan for Cyprus, Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Twitter on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch finance minister said the meeting to discuss a fifth financial rescue following those for Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and for Spanish banks, would begin at 5:00pm (1600 GMT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key issue going into the talks concerns calls by some eurozone partners for a reduction, or haircut, on the value of deposits in local banks, which the finance minister of cash-strapped Cyprus last week said would be catastrophic, not only for Cyprus but the entire 17-nation bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have repeated in the strongest terms that this is not an issue that is on the table,&quot; Finance Minister Michalis Sarris told reporters in Nicosia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives from a troika of international lenders -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- have been on the island gathering information on semi-governmental organisations as part of a deal to finalise financial aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To seal a bailout agreement Nicosia might need to sell state assets, agree a sum on bank recapitalisation and refute claims that Cyprus has become a haven for money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mooted 17-billion euro ($22.2 billion) bailout figure is roughly the same as the island's total economic output, and would increase debt to more than 140 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a level considered unmanageable in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurozone finance ministers said at their last meeting that the long-delayed bailout deal could be struck by the end of March after Nicosia agreed to submit its banks to independent scrutiny owing to worries over money-laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those concerns stem from allegations that the island is a favoured destination for the ill-gotten gains of Russian oligarchs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyprus requested financial assistance from the EU in June after its two largest banks asked for state aid to help compensate for losses estimated at 4.5 billion euros that were sustained when they agreed to take part in a massive write-down of the Greek debt held by private creditors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN WELLS, California, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria Sharapova stepped it up when she had to on Tuesday to set up an Indian Wells quarter-final clash with Sara Errani, a rematch of last year's French Open final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's Sharapova defeated Errani in straight sets in the championship match at Roland Garros to complete a career Grand Slam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian star, who won Indian Wells in 2006 and finished runner-up last year to Victoria Azarenka, started slowly against Spain's Lara Arruabarrena-Vecino but turned up the heat to win 7-5, 6-0.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharapova dropped her first service game to hand the Spaniard a 2-0 lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then broke Arruabarrena-Vecino twice, but was broken again before winning the last three games of the opening set. From there she never looked back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just didn't get a good rhythm on her game from the beginning,&quot; Sharapova said. &quot;I think maybe I was going for the lines a little bit more than I had to, especially in the first few games when you don't know too much about your opponent or haven't played her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought towards the end of the first and beginning of the second set I really stepped it up, was being more aggressive and really gave myself a better margin than I did throughout the first set.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharapova delivered a stellar serving display in the second set, firing four of her five aces and never facing a break point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Errani, who won the women's clay-court title in Acapulco in the build-up to Indian Wells, advanced with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over ninth-seeded Marion Bartoli of France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think one of her biggest keys is her consistency and her ability to make her opponent play,&quot; Sharapova said of Errani. &quot;She doesn't make many mistakes.  You've really got to win the match out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top-seeded Azarenka also advanced, shrugging off a sore ankle to beat Urszula Radwanska 6-3, 6-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Azarenka remained unbeaten in a 2013 season that has included an Australian Open triumph and a WTA title at Doha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the win over Radwanska, ranked 37th in the world, was tougher than the scoreline might suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was pretty obvious that I wasn't feeling that well,&quot; said Azarenka, who had three double faults in dropping her serve in the fourth game of the opening set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My ankle was bothering me. It has been bothering me for a while, so it hasn't been really getting better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But on the bright side, I won the match,&quot; added Azarenka, who next faces eighth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wozniacki, the 2011 Indian Wells winner, beat Russian Nadia Petrova 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian Maria Kirilenko upset third seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-1, 4-6, 7-5. Kirilenko, seeking a second title of 2013 after her triumph in Pattaya City, will play former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, the fifth seed, who beat Klara Zakapalova 6-2, 6-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth-seeded Angelique Kerber of Germany and Aussie Samantha Stosur complete the quarter-final line-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerber defeated Spanish qualifier Garbine Muguruza 6-4, 7-5 and Stosur downed Germany's Mona Barthel 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WARSAW, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not as ornate the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, but a life-sized replica of the polychrome ceiling of an 18th-century synagogue inspired awe Tuesday as it was unveiled in the Polish capital. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Covered in richly coloured Old Testament scenes and lushly stylised floral themes, the original ceiling adorned a wooden synagogue in what was the pre-World War II eastern Polish town of Gwozdziec, near what is now Lviv, western Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like thousands of other Jewish religious sites, it was destroyed during the war by Nazi Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its modern replica is the centrepiece of the Polish capital's new Museum of the History of Polish Jews, due to be formally inaugurated April 19, marking the 70th anniversary of the World War II Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Its door will open to the public next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's unveiling was &quot;a very special day for the museum because it is the first major element of our permanent exhibition to be installed and it is perhaps the most spectacular element&quot;, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, the museum's programme director, told AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is really an important symbol of Polish-Jewish life over a thousand years and the relationship between Jews and their Polish neighbours,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The replica, created by Polish artists, pays tribute to the 18th-century artists and craftsmen who created the original, which according to Kirshenblatt-Gimblett &quot;represents the peak of Polish-Jewish creativity&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The replica was handcrafted from wood using traditional tools and techniques and involved nearly 300 craftspeople and artists from around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new museum is being built in the heart of the Polish capital on the site of the Jewish ghetto that became a symbol of resistance to Nazi Germany's efforts to eradicate 1,000 years of Jewish presence in Poland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Designed by Finnish architects Rainer Mahlamaeki and Ilmar Lahdelma, the new museum faces the imposing black-stone Warsaw Ghetto Uprising memorial dedicated to those who perished in the doomed 1943 Jewish revolt against the Nazis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gaping hole on its facade symbolises the Biblical parting of the Red Sea, which allowed the Prophet Moses to lead the Jews out of bondage in ancient Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new museum boasts an exhibition area of 12,800 square metres (138,000 square feet) including a multimedia hall sitting 450 people, an education centre, a kids corner, a restaurant and a cafe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project is financed by private donors, German foundations as well as the Polish government, the city of Warsaw and the European Union. It is expected to cost 160 million zlotys (38.6 million euros, $50.4 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In eight themed halls, visitors will learn about the arrival of Jews in Poland who had fled Spain, and about how Jewish life flourished there until the period between the two world wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last halls focuses on the Holocaust and the post-war period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1939, Poland was home to some 3.3 million Jews, of whom 400,000 lived in the capital Warsaw. The Jewish community then made up 10 percent of Poland's population and one-third of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Middle Ages on, Poland received Jewish refugees from Spain, the German region of Rhineland, and France.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian Premier League leaders CSKA Moscow are plagued by injury concerns ahead of Sunday's visit of FC Krasnodar, as second-placed Anzhi Makhachkala aim to bounce back.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSKA, who lead Anzhi by five points and Zenit St Petersburg by eight points, are missing Japanese midfielder Keisuke Honda and star forward Seydou Doumbia of Ivory Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are both training individually and their participation in Sunday's match at Moscow Luzhniki stadium is still in question,&quot; the club said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Red Army side will be able to bolster their line-up with Latvian international midfielder Alexander Cauna, who has overcame a minor leg injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big-spending Anzhi, who unexpectedly lost at lowly Saransk last time out, will be looking to get back on track at home to Samara on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dagestanis will be boosted by a sell-out crowd at their new 30,000-seat Anzhi Arena, which was recently opened after a major refurbishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a crucial week for coach Guus Hiddink's side as they also face a Europa League return leg clash at Newcastle, with the tie finely poised at 0-0, just three days before hosting Samara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very disappointed by the loss of points in our previous Russian league match,&quot; said Dutchman Hiddink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore in this week's matches (with Newcastle and Samara) we cannot afford further losses. We shall learn by our own mistakes to avoid repeating them in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, defending champions Zenit, who have suffered three consecutive defeats in all competitions -- to Liverpool, Basel and Rubin Kazan -- take on the buoyant Saransk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saint Petersburg outfit, who have struggled defensively this year, also face a crucial week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do they have a mountain to climb to catch CSKA but they trail Basel 2-0 from their Europa League first leg in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia's most decorated club Spartak, who share fourth with Kuban Krasnodar, play Lokomotiv in a Moscow derby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We started well after the winter break,&quot; Spartak head coach Valery Karpin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we always remember that every match is a new challenge and we need points in all of the remaining league matches to achieve something serious this season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The upcoming match with Lokomotiv will be definitely a tough challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">London, March 14 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arsenal's elimination at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League means this is the first season since 1995-96 in which no English teams have reached the quarter-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an ignominious group phase, when Manchester City finished bottom of their pool and Chelsea became the first defending champions to fall at the first hurdle, the English challenge vanished amid the first flowerings of the European spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Manchester United and Arsenal acquitted themselves commendably in their respective losses to Real Madrid and Bayern in the last 16, but the English teams no longer dominate the tournament as they once did.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a massive disappointment for English football. It is a massive wake-up call for us,&quot; said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you think of the teams who have gone out, like Manchester United, City, Chelsea and now us, it is a long time since that happened and it shows that the rest of European football has caught up with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last season, despite Chelsea's improbable triumph, the warning signs were already present in the group-stage exits of the two Manchester clubs and Arsenal's 4-0 thrashing by AC Milan at San Siro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears to represent a startling fall from grace for a country that has produced finalists in seven of the last eight seasons, and which supplied three of the semi-finalists in 2007, 2008 and 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, only two teams have reached the last four - United, in 2011, and Chelsea, in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change in fortunes has coincided with a marked shift in the English game towards more risky, attacking football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of goals per game in the Premier League has risen year on year since 2008, soaring from 2.48 in the 2008-09 season to 2.85 in the current campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United conceded only 22 goals en route to the English title in 2008. This season, they had let in as many by the second week in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the uncompromising arena of the Champions League, that defensive generosity has been ruthlessly exploited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country best placed to profit from England's woes is Germany, which has supplied two quarter-finalists for the first time since 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bayern are driven by the pain of the loss to Chelsea in last year's final, while Borussia Dortmund finished above Madrid, City and Ajax in Group D before crushing highly regarded Shakhtar Donetsk 5-2 on aggregate in the last 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bayern have always had capable and confident teams. Last year they should have won the final and have added to their squad this year with Javi Martinez and Mario Mandzukic up front,&quot; says United manager Alex Ferguson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are going to have a chance. But the dark horse is definitely Dortmund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think they are paying too much attention to the league. Their concentration is on the European Cup and their European form has been very good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allied to the robust financial health of the German game, and with Pep Guardiola having shunned Chelsea's overtures to take over as Bayern coach at the end of the season, it points to a potential power shift in European football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite the apparent realignment of the continent's tectonic plates, not everyone is prepared to entertain talk of a sea change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho, for one, feels it is too soon to write off the giants of the English game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;English football is English football,&quot; he said ahead of his side's victory over United.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Spanish teams are out of the Champions League ... it doesn't mean Spanish football is collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manchester City were out because the draw gave them a difficult group. Chelsea were also in a difficult group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is football. The results sometimes don't reflect the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier League superstars like Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard can only hope Mourinho is right, as they adjust to the unwelcome novelty of watching the tournament's decisive matches from the discomfort of their living rooms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN WELLS, California, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World No. 1 Novak Djokovic survived a rocky start to defeat Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 on Tuesday and reach the fourth round of the Indian Wells ATP Masters and WTA tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic, unbeaten in a 2013 campaign that so far includes a fourth Australian Open title and an ATP triumph in Dubai, was on the ropes in the opening set against the 21-year-old Bulgarian, who raced to a 4-1 lead and served for the set at 5-3.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dimitrov served up four double faults in the ninth game and was broken, and that was the only opening that Djokovic needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serbian star battled back to win in 67 minutes. He raced to a 5-0 lead en route to winning the first-set tiebreaker and didn't face a break point in the second frame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic wrapped it up with a love game, sealing the victory with a service winner on match point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was not really a beautiful match to watch,&quot; Djokovic said. &quot;There were a lot of unforced errors, and we both looked quite sluggish on the court, very slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In these kind of matches, where both of us don't feel so dynamic on the court, I knew that experience will kick in and can be decisive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's actually what happened. He made four double faults which is very unusual to see in men's tennis nowadays, but, look, that's tennis. Turned it around, and from then on I felt a little bit better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djokovic improved to 15-0 in 2013 and 20-0 since October 31 -- when he lost to American Sam Querrey in the Paris Masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll get a chance to avenge that defeat in a fourth-round meeting with Querrey, who edged Australian Marinko Matosevic 7-6 (7/5), 6-7 (7/9), 7-5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighth-seeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and 17th-seeded Canadian Milos Raonic set up a rematch of their record-breaking London Olympics clash, when Tsonga out-lasted Raonic 6-3, 3-6, 25-23 in the second round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 48-game final set was the longest single set in Olympic history, a record that takes into account all men's and women's matches in both singles and doubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsonga held off American Mardy Fish 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/0) while Raonic rallied for a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Croatian Marin Cilic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, 12 men's seeds were in third-round action on Tuesday, including world No. 3 Andy Murray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murray, playing his first tournament since losing to Djokovic in the Australian Open final in January, was due to take on Taiwan's Lu Yen-Hsun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lu stunned Murray in the first round at the 2008 Beijing Olympics -- a disappointment Murray made up for with his gold medal performance before adoring British fans at the London Games last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the top 10 women's seeds were among the 16 players fighting for quarter-final berths, led by top seed and defending champion Victoria Azarenka and second-seeded Russian Maria Sharapova.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharapova started slow but came on strong in a 7-5, 6-0 victory over 87th-ranked Spaniard Lara Arruabarrena-Vecino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Azarenka was due to take on Urszula Radwanska, sister of third-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska who played Russian Maria Kirilenko.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US authorities were investigating Tuesday after hackers posted personal financial data belonging to First Lady Michelle Obama, the head of the FBI and several A-list celebrities online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hackers using a Russian web address published the credit reports and social security numbers for Obama, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller, US Attorney General Eric Holder, and Los Angeles Police Chief Charles Beck.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also posted social security numbers and other personal information relating to Vice President Joe Biden and former first lady and secretary of state Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entertainment stars Beyonce and husband Jay-Z, Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and Britney Spears also saw details leaked, as did tycoon Donald Trump, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and bodybuilder-turned-actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama was asked about the alleged incident during an interview with ABC News, and while not confirming the details, said that hacking was a growing problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should not be surprised that if we've got hackers that want to dig in and have a lot of resources, that they can access this information,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a big problem. I'm not confirming that that's what happened, but you've got websites out there right now that sell people's credit cards that have been stolen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three leading personal credit-rating agencies acknowledged the files were accessed illegally, but said it was done through other firms by someone  using the personal data of the victims, and not by hacking their own computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This looks to be an isolated situation in which criminals accessed personal credential information through various outside sources, which provided them with sufficient information to illegally access a limited number of individual reports from some US credit reporting agencies,&quot; said Experian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Upon learning of the situation, we took immediate action to freeze the credit files of those victimized by this malicious attack in an effort to minimize impact to those individuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transunion, the source of Michelle Obama's credit report, said its own systems &quot;were not hacked or compromised in any way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perpetrators &quot;had considerable amounts of information about the victims, including social security numbers and other sensitive, personal identifying information that enabled them to successfully impersonate the victims over the Internet,&quot; it said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data also came from two others services, Equifax and CreditKarma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI and the US Secret Service, which protects the president and his family, both said they were investigating the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FBI spokeswoman Jennifer Shearer said she could not provide any details on the probe or confirm the identities of the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they are supposed to be restricted, financial companies vetting individuals for loans and credit cards have easy access to the records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals can also obtain their own credit records online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not clear who posted the details. The data was placed on a website with a web address with the &quot;.su&quot; root indicating the Soviet Union -- an address still controlled by Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The website led with a quote from the US cable television series &quot;Dexter&quot; about a policeman-turned-serial killer: &quot;If you believe that God makes miracles, you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his sleeve.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsonga and Fish exchanged a total of six service breaks in the second set, Fish surging to a 4-0 lead with two breaks of serve before Tsonga won four straight games to level the set at 4-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deciding tiebreaker, however, was all Tsonga as he improved to 4-0 against the American.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain would consider ignoring a European Union arms ban and supplying weapons to Syrian rebels if it would help topple President Bashar al-Assad, Prime Minister David Cameron said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU last month amended its embargo to allow member nations to supply &quot;non-lethal&quot; equipment and training to the opposition but stopped short of lifting the embargo entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by a parliamentary committee whether Britain would veto the arms embargo when it comes up for renewal in three months' time, Cameron said he would &quot;like to continue with an EU approach.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope that we can persuade our European partners if and when it becomes necessary (to provide weapons) they'll agree with us,&quot; he told the House of Commons Liaison Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if we can't, then it's not out of the question we might have to do things in our own way. It's possible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still an independent country, we can have an independent foreign policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed on whether Britain could sidestep the arms ban, Cameron said: &quot;If for instance we felt that action needed to be taken to help bring about change in Syria, to help end this appalling bloodshed, and if we felt our European partners were holding that back, then we'd have to change the approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the committee said that arming the rebels could be risky the British premier replied: &quot;That is not a decision we've taken and I hope we don't have to break from a collaborative approach across the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was just making a point that if we thought that was the right thing to do, we would do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's worth standing back and asking &quot;Why are we doing this?&quot; It seems that if we want to help bring about a transition in Syria, we have to work with opposition groups,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 27-member EU is split over whether to supply arms to the Syrian rebels, with Britain, France and Italy tipping in favour of eventual military aid for the opposition and Germany and others warning against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on Monday suggested the bloc may need to rethink its strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems obvious to me that the question of lifting the arms embargo will be increasingly on the table due to the evident imbalance between Bashar al-Assad, who is being supplied with powerful weaponry from Iran and Russia, and the National Coalition, which does not have such weapons,&quot; Fabius said after talks with his 26 EU counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assad turned his sights on Britain earlier this month, accusing its government of wanting to arm &quot;terrorists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can we expect them to make the violence less while they want to send military supplies to the terrorists and don't try to ease the dialogue between the Syrians?&quot; Assad told The Sunday Times in a video-taped interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that &quot;Britain has played a famously unconstructive role in different issues for decades, some say for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with this government is that their shallow and immature rhetoric only highlights this tradition of a bullying hegemony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Foreign Secretary William Hague reacted to the interview by charging that the Syrian leader was &quot;delusional&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU is the largest humanitarian donor for the Syrian crisis, with more than 428 million euros ($556 million) sent to help distressed Syrians inside and outside the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria warned Tuesday it is ready to fight &quot;for years&quot; against rebels, as world powers worked on a new initiative to find regime officials suitable for peace talks with the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN children's agency UNICEF said an entire generation risked being lost in the spiralling conflict between President Bashar al-Assad's forces and insurgents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the bloodletting approached a third year without a solution in sight, France said it was working with Russia and the United States to draw up a list of regime officials with whom the opposition can negotiate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said &quot;we worked together on an idea... of a list of Syrian officials who would be acceptable to Syria's opposition National Coalition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition chief Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib has offered to talk to regime representatives without &quot;blood on their hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain said it would consider ignoring a European Union arms ban and could supply weapons to rebels if it would help topple Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister David Cameron said he hoped London could persuade its EU partners &quot;if and when it becomes necessary (to provide weapons) they'll agree with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the EU amended its embargo to allow members to supply &quot;non-lethal&quot; equipment and training to the opposition but stopped short of lifting the embargo entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether Britain would veto the arms embargo when it comes up for renewal in three months, Cameron told a parliamentary committee he would &quot;like to continue with an EU approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if we can't, then it's not out of the question we might have to do things in our own way. It's possible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if arming the rebels could be risky, he replied: &quot;That is not a decision we've taken and I hope we don't have to break from a collaborative approach across the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was just making a point that if we thought that was the right thing to do, we would do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU is split over arming the rebels. Britain, France and Italy are tipping in favour of it, while Germany and others warn against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ground, rebels and troops fought fierce battles over the contested district of Baba Amr in third city Homs, and clashed on the road linking Damascus to the international airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-government newspaper Al-Watan said the army was &quot;in perfect condition&quot; and that it &quot;has at its disposal enough men and weapons to fight for years to defend Syria&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria &quot;is in a state of war&quot; and &quot;facing a real invasion,&quot; it said, stressing citizens could also join in the battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assad's regime, which has consistently blamed foreign powers for the violence, also sent letters to the UN urging &quot;pressure on certain Arab and Western countries that supply aid to terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Homs, fighting focused on Khaldiyeh, with regime forces backed by tanks pounding the northern district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Troops launched rockets from the Baath University into parts of Baba Amr,&quot; said the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battles also raged on the road linking Damascus to the airport, said the watchdog. Rebels have been trying to seize control of the road for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Observatory said 77 people had died in violence across Syria on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Geneva, UNESCO sent out an SOS that a whole generation of Syrian children could disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the crisis in Syria enters its third, tragic year without any end in sight, the risk of a lost generation grows every hour, every day and every month,&quot; UNICEF spokesman Patrick McCormick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot afford to lose any more time. We certainly cannot afford to lose another year. We risk creating a generation of children who have seen, or know, only fighting, and may well end up perpetuating that cycle of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF pointed out that nearly half of the four million in dire need of aid inside Syria are under the age of 18, and 536,000 of them are children under five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia meanwhile delivered 10 tonnes of aid to Syria, SANA news agency said, and evacuated 103 citizens from the country, according to news reports from Moscow.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two topless feminist activists staged a protest on the edge of St Peter's Square on Tuesday as cardinals began a conclave to elect a new pope.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pope No More!&quot; one of the women shouted, before she was dragged away by several police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman had &quot;Paedophilia No More&quot; scrawled on her bare chest and &quot;Pope No More&quot; on her back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second woman had &quot;War No More&quot; on her chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also let off pink flares -- a parody of the white smoke from the roof of the Sistine Chapel that will signal a pope has been elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women, who said they were from the Ukrainian group Femen, were detained and taken to a local police station near the famous Vatican plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Femen women's power group has been making headlines since 2010 for topless feminist, pro-democracy and anti-corruption protests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rescuers took four days to reach the wreckage of a UN helicopter that crashed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and finally found the bodies of the four Russian crew on Tuesday, the UN said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cargo helicopter crashed on Saturday but bad weather stopped the UN mission in DR Congo, MONUSCO, from getting to the wreckage about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Bukavu in South Kivu province, UN officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wreck of the helicopter was spotted on Sunday, but bad weather and difficulties in access slowed down the rescue operation,&quot; said a MONUSCO statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the search team reached the accident site on Tuesday and confirmed that the four Russians were dead, MONUSCO said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The helicopter, under contract to the UN, had been returning to Bukavu from a mission to Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon &quot;offers his sincerest condolences and sympathy to the families and friends of the victims, and to the government of the Russian Federation,&quot; said a statement released by Ban's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MONUSCO has launched an immediate investigation into the cause of the crash,&quot; Ban added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accident was the latest in a series for the UN in DR Congo. In April 2011, 32 people were killed when a plane chartered by MONUSCO crashed near Kinshasa airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of MONUSCO's 19,000 troops and police are deployed in the mineral-rich but conflict-ridden eastern provinces of DR Congo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday he intends to nominate Kremlin economic adviser and his close ally Elvira Nabiullina to parliament as Russia's next central bank chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nabiullina, who served as economic development minister in the last government, would replace the widely-trusted Sergei Ignatyev who is retiring after heading the Bank Rossii (Bank of Russia) since 2002. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I intend to propose the candidature of Elvira Nabiullina for the post of chairman of the Russian central bank,&quot; Putin said in televised remarks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The years of the crisis, most difficult and dangerous for our economy, passed with relatively minimal losses, including due to your input,&quot; Putin told Ignatyev as he met with both the outgoing chief and Nabiullina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists had been nervous about Putin's eagerly-anticipated decision for one of the top economic posts in Russia, at a time when the country is seeking to balance declining growth with resurgent inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a trusted advisor of Putin, Nabiullina's appointment may reassure some who were fearing he could make a far wilder choice like his much more radical economic aide Sergei Glazyev or banker Andrei Kostin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her reputation as a close ally of the president may trigger fears that Nabiullina will be ready to heat up the economy by trimming rates and stoke up inflation expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nabiullina is considered too close to Putin and, thus, definitely open to political pressure,&quot; said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist at Renaissance Capital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When she was economy minister, she always supported a macroeconomic policy that was at odds with the more conservative and prudent approach pursued by the finance ministry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nabiullina will mean higher inflationary expectations and weaker currency. This will still be a blow to central banks perceived independence,&quot; he said in emailed comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nabiullina, 49, said she would like Ignatyev to stay on as her advisor if she is formally appointed by the Russian parliament, as required. Ignatyev's four-year tenure expires on June 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If confirmed, Nabiullina will become one of the most prominent female figures in Russian public life and one of few officials of Muslim origin to hold a major federal post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A native of the Muslim region of Bashkortostan, soft-spoken Nabiullina worked in the economy ministry in the 1990s. After a brief stint in the commercial sector, she went back to the government with Putin's ascent to the Kremlin in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She served as economy minister when Putin became prime minister in 2008, and shifted to the Kremlin together with many other ministers as he began his third presidential term last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her ministry frequently clashed with fiscal hawks of the finance ministry led by Alexei Kudrin, especially during the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her imminent appointment comes as the Bank of Russia is facing key policy choices as it tries to keep a lid on resurgent inflation without harming economic growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s relatively hawkish recent stance has frustrated some of Putin&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s allies who want looser monetary policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank of Russia won respect during the 2008-2009 financial crisis with well-calculated injections of liquidity into the economy and finely-judged currency interventions to support the ruble that saved Russia from an even deeper crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignatyev, 65, is a dignified economist respected by markets who turned the bank&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s policy priority towards keeping inflation in check at a time of high oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking last week, Putin said the new chief would be &quot;an unexpected figure&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nabiullina's name had not come up as a rumoured possibility until Monday; other candidates included Ignatyev's deputy Alexei Ulyukayev, Alexei Kudrin, and VTB state bank chief Andrei Kostin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists believe Nabiullina may be more inclined to cut Russia's main refinancing rate which currently stands at 8.25 percent. The central bank has until now resisted pressure to begin a cutting cycle to support lagging growth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Il-62 plane left from Latakia airport in western Syria where President Bashar al-Assad enjoys his strongest support at 1440 GMT, news agencies quoted a ministry spokeswoman as saying.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coordinated airlift would be read as a signal of Moscow's admission that Assad's regime was on the brink of collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia has vetoed three rounds of UN Security Council sanctions against Assad and has said that the Syrian strongman must be taken at his word when he says he has no intention to quit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 300 members of Russia's Bolshoi Theatre rose Tuesday to the defence of a top dancer who was charged with masterminding a sulphuric acid attack against the ballet's artistic director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police detained Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko last week along with the suspected perpetrator and getaway driver in the plot against Sergei Filin that left him with eye damage and facial disfigurement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dmitrichenko admitted to organising the attack in footage aired on Russian state television before changing his testimony and saying that he never intended for acid to be used.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theatre's crew -- including dancers but also the choir and orchestra members as well as stage staff -- said in a letter to President Vladimir Putin and the government that the confession seemed forced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For everyone who knows Dmitrichenko, the very idea that he could have thought of and ordered this crime -- committed in such a brutal manner -- is absurd,&quot; said a copy of the letter published on the website of Moscow Echo radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The conclusion made by the investigation seems premature to us, the evidence unconvincing and Pavel's confession itself, which was later changed, the result of strong pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moscow Echo said that the signatories included star male dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze whom theatre management accused of creating the atmosphere that led to the attack and who is reportedly a friend of Dmitrichenko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also singing the document was Anzhelina Vorontsova -- Dmitrichenko's girlfriend who Filin had allegedly passed over for top roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much-loved ballerina Maria Alexandrova signed the document but it appeared that the Bolshoi's best known dancer -- prima ballerina Svetlana Zakharova -- had not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not clear if the letter had universal support among the huge workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filin's lawyer Tatyana Stukalova said the letter played into the interests of those unidentified forces for whom Dmitrichenko was acting as cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bolshoi Theatre Director Anatoly Iksanov said his position precluded him from signing the letter but that he agreed with those who did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moscow's police department responded to the letter by noting that it had &quot;great respect&quot; for the Bolshoi and would deliver all its findings from the investigation to its cast as soon as they became available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarkable case has highlighted the rivalries and politics that have poisoned relations in the Bolshoi  -- formed in 1776 and the cultural ace of the Soviet Union and Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dmitrichenko was not the Bolshoi's top dancers but had still been assigned several prominent roles. He became especially known for playing antagonists such as the feared tsar in the ballet &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; ballet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His attorney said Tuesday that his client was ready to cooperate with the investigation but not to assume the blame for the use of acid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both he and I have a firm position stating that he never asked anyone to douse anyone with acid, causing severe injury,&quot; lawyer Alexander Barkanov was quoted as saying by the RAPSI legal news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filin had said he had received telephone threats and had the tyre of his cars slashed before being doused in the face with sulphuric acid on his way home on January 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with Russian television from his rehabilitation in Germany, Filin said Dmitrichenko belonged to a &quot;narrow circle&quot; of people who wished him ill but also hinted higher forces could have been involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every moment, every meeting I had with Pavel Dmitrichenko involved another threat or another demonstration of his dislike for me, and I do not intend to hide this now,&quot; Filin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had no ill feelings toward Pavel Dmitrichenko,&quot; said Filin. &quot;But it seems that someone was working especially hard and pushing&quot; Dmitrichenko toward an eventual attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filin appeared in the interview with his head wrapped in a thick black scarf and his eye hidden by large dark glasses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cabinet has approved a contract between Syrian Arab Airlines and Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov for the purchase of 10 civilian aircraft, in a bid to strengthen Syria's fleet,&quot; SANA said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report did not specify the type of aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian Arab Airlines currently only runs flights from the strife-torn country to Armenia, Iran, Russia and several Arab states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US sanctions imposed on Syria in 2004 have affected the carrier's small fleet, which in 2008 only had six Airbus planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions specifically accused Damascus of backing terrorism. They forbade the airline from entering US airspace, as well as the export of certain US products to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syrian order several years ago of Airbus planes was cancelled after the United States demanded documents from the European manufacturer to ensure the aircraft did not contain US-made parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, the EU blacklisted the airline and forbade its planes from landing on European territory, because of the regime's brutal crackdown on dissent after the eruption of an anti-regime revolt in March 2011.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief suspect in the polonium poisoning of Russian dissident and ex-security agent Alexander Litvinenko said Tuesday he would take no further part in the British inquest into the death, blaming London's decision to keep some sensitive material secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian lawmaker Andrei Lugovoi said that his legal representatives would no longer take part in the inquest or present evidence, claiming that he had lost faith in the British justice system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am forced to announce that I am pulling out of the coroners' inquest and will not take part in it any more,&quot; Lugovoi said at a news conference, flanked by his lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact-finding inquest into Litvinenko's death -- which does not rule on guilt -- is expected to begin later this year. So far there have been pre-inquest hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lugovoi blamed his decision on British Foreign Secretary William Hague's request to keep some of the evidence secret in the interest of national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is the position of Britain to make it secret and there is my position: not to take part because it has been made secret, because I don't see the point,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I finally lost faith in the very possibility of an unprejudiced investigation of this case in Britain,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole process looks like a farce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hague's decision has also prompted complaints from British media and Litvinenko's widow Marina, whose lawyers have argued the block is a cover-up to improve relations with Russia after it emerged in the pre-inquest review that Litvinenko worked for British spy agency MI6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquest will examine the possible involvement of Lugovoi and another Russian, Dmitry Kovtun, in Litvinenko's death as well as the possible involvement of Russian state agencies, according to a website on the inquest set up by Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former spy and now lawmaker for a nationalist party has been named by British police as the chief suspect in Litvinenko's 2006 murder after apparently drinking tea laced by polonium, but Russia refuses to extradite him in a row that has strained ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lugovoi said he has no intention of going to Britain while he is a suspect. But he confirmed that he had hired a British legal firm to represent him at the inquest that would not now be doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think our presence would have given us more opportunity to present evidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what's the sense of presenting one's own evidence if we will never be able to overturn the evidence that will be secretly handed to the coroner?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He waved a copy of the report of the investigation by Greater London Police's Counter Terrorism Command into Litvinenko's death, translated into Russian, which he slammed as &quot;the politicised fantasy of London detectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Lugovoi, self-exiled oligarch and arch-foe of President Vladimir Putin who now lives in Britain, Boris Berezovsky was behind the killing, which Berezovsky denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The version is still Berezovsky,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversially, he said that he could name witnesses named in the report only as D1 and D2, giving the names of two men he said worked actively with Berezovsky. Their anonymity is protected by a British court order. The police report will be part of the inquest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmaker banged the table several times as he spoke but smiled when asked if he still suffered from effects of the radiation dose he also received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel great, I don't suffer from polonium,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in an interview last week said that Russia was calling for the inquest and the public to have full access to all the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lugovoi's announcement came a day before Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu were due to meet their British counterparts in London in a meeting seen as aimed at warming relations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We judge that there is a remote chance of a major cyber attack against US critical infrastructure systems during the next two years that would result in long-term, wide-scale disruption of services, such as a regional power outage,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report placed more importance on cyber threats than previous years, with more words on the problem than on Islamist militants in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Russia and China, were unlikely to launch a massive digital assault on the United States unless there was a military conflict or grave crisis that put their national interests at risk, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;there is a risk that unsophisticated attacks would have significant outcomes due to unexpected system configurations and mistakes, or that vulnerability at one node might spill over and contaminate other parts of a networked system,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-Kremlin lawmakers on Tuesday proposed banning members of parliament from travelling abroad amid spiralling tensions between Moscow and Washington about Russia's human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Duma lower house of parliament deputy Mikhail Starshinov said the unusual restriction was necessary because lawmakers were missing important work days and even flying on state funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do we lack in today's legislation and Duma regulations that prevent us from effectively instituting this (measure)?&quot; Starshinov asked on the private Dozhd TV channel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was forced to take action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal to get the Duma speaker to authorise each foreign trip was formed in response to a trip to the United States by Dmitry Gudkov -- an opposition member who has ridiculed Russia's new ban on adoptions by US families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maverick Duma deputy Vladimir Zhirinovsky on Tuesday even proposed arresting Gudkov for &quot;treason&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have the right to hate the (Russian) regime,&quot; said Zhirinovsky. &quot;But the authorities, the country and the regime are here. So give up your (Duma) mandate,&quot; he urged Gudkov.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other deputies said Gudkov and others were using the days lawmakers were assigned to visit their constituencies to attend personal business in other countries on budget money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that Gudkov is paying a Russophobe visit to the United States is disgraceful in and of itself,&quot; Public Chamber advisory body member Georgy Fedotov told news agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I want to know whose money he travelled on,&quot; Fedotov said. &quot;Why should the State Duma pay for this boorish behaviour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gudkov said he spent two days in the United States visiting American families who had successfully adopted Russian children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also spoke before the Freedom House human rights foundation about ways to fight Russian corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gudkov himself said he saw little chance of the legislation passing because so many Duma deputies owned property and illicitly ran businesses abroad -- a charge often repeated by Russia's opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be no legislative initiative because our deputies, senators, bureaucrats and security officials have parked large sums of money in American banks,&quot; he told Russian News Service Radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have property there. Their children go to school there. And their families live there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Duma was torn by scandal earlier this year when anti-Kremlin campaigner Alexei Navalny disclosed how a top member of the ruling party who lobbied for the US adoptions ban in fact owned property in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmaker eventually resigned after initially denying the charge. The Duma has since also mulled a measure that would bar deputies from owning property abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even some lawmakers from the United Russia party that runs the chamber for the Kremlin admitted that the travel ban might never be put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is little chance that we will implement a strict ban,&quot; United Russia State Duma faction leader Vladimir Vasilyev told Moscow Echo radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Russia and the United States have suffered since Vladimir Putin's return to a third presidential term last May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin accused Washington of financing the large street protests that preceded his election and then fought bitterly with Western countries over Moscow's refusal to sanction the Syrian regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ties plunged to a new low when the United States slapped travel bans and banking limitations on Russians implicated in the death in custody of the whistleblowing attorney Sergei Magnitsky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia retaliated by passing its adoptions ban and threatening other reprisal measures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrestling can regain its place as a core Olympic sport for the 2020 Games, the interim president of the sport's world governing body, Nenad Lalovic, told AFP in an interview on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 54-year-old Serbian said the future of the sport -- one of the few to have breached the divide between the ancient and the modern Games -- was at stake and it was effectively facing a battle for its survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 15 members of the International Olympic Committee's executive board decided in early February that the sport should be dropped from the 2020 Games, sparking outrage among wrestlers and fans and prompting a campaign for it to be reinstated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lalovic, who succeeded Raphael Martinetti as head of the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) in the wake of the IOC decision, said he hoped reforms proposed since then would show they had taken criticism on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a battle for the survival of the sport,&quot; Lalovic told AFP by telephone from FILA headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. &quot;If it's not in the Games then it will receive less money and make it hard to keep going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, wrestlers never know when they are beaten and if I wasn't optimistic I wouldn't have accepted the challenge. It is a huge challenge and it is a precarious situation that we find ourselves in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must do everything in our power to regain our place in the Olympics. However, I am confident that we will regain our place for 2020. There is a unified spirit among our members and a steely resolve from the national federations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a serious and competitive sport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lalovic, preferred by FILA members over Martinetti to spearhead an overhaul of wrestling, has already initiated several sweeping reforms, including an increase in women's participation at all levels of the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also conducting a review of the rules of wrestling with the intent of making the sport more understandable and attractive to spectators and less dependent upon subjective officiating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, FILA is reviewing the presentation of the sport to modernise the competition format while initiatives are also underway to boost marketing and promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These will have to be approved at an extraordinary general meeting of its heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are following the advice of the IOC members about how best to reform our sport so it is suited to the present Olympic Games,&quot; said Lalovic, who held what he termed productive talks with IOC president Jacques Rogge last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are aligning our sport with the development of other sports in the IOC. However, to say and to do is one thing. It is easy to talk but you have to implement the measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that wrestling modernises and adapts. However, it is not just for wrestling to do those things, for all sports are in danger. Each sport must adapt because it is not easy these days to motivate a child to go out and do sports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They prefer to sit in front of their TV or computer and play Nintendo or other games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrestling's ouster from the core Olympic programme for 2020 led to an outpouring of support, even uniting bitter political foes Iran -- where the sport has a rich history dating back to the times of Persian kings -- and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lalovic said he had not been surprised at the outcry but said wrestling was at a disadvantage in preparing their presentation to the IOC executive board in St Petersburg, Russia, at the end of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrestling will have to make its case along with the seven sports hoping to replace it and it is likely that the board will recommend two or three sports to the overall IOC membership to vote on in their Congress in Buenos Aires in early September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our problem is that we have less time to prepare, just two-and-a-half months, than the others who have had years to put their dossier together,&quot; said Lalovic. &quot;We are in a race against time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, though, does not blame the IOC for the predicament that wrestling finds itself in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were asleep,&quot; he said. &quot;We hadn't gone down the modernising path of development other sports had followed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday confirmed that four Russians reported missing were killed when their helicopter crashed in a remote eastern region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the UN mission (MONUSCO) announced &quot;the death of four crew members on board a civilian helicopter that crashed (on Saturday) about 20 kilometres (12 miles) west of the town of Bukavu, in South Kivu province&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the members of the crew were of Russian nationality,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wreck of the helicopter was spotted on Sunday, but bad weather and difficulties in access slowed down the rescue operation,&quot; is added. A member of the salvage team reached the accident site on Tuesday and confirmed that the four Russians were dead, MONUSCO said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The helicopter disappeared &quot;when it was returning to Bukavu&quot;, the chief town in the unstable South Kivu province, &quot;after a mission to Shabunda&quot;, added the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 2011, 32 people were killed in the capital Kinshasa when a plane chartered by MONUSCO crashed. The UN mission has been in the vast central African country since 1999 in a bid to help restore stability and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of MONUSCO's 19,000 foreign troops and police are deployed in the mineral-rich but conflict-ridden eastern provinces, which are prey to numerous armed movements in the wake of back-to-back civil wars that drew in other countries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian officials on Tuesday proposed ideas ranging from planting beacon transmitters on asteroids to megaton-sized nuclear strikes to avert the threat from meteor collisions with the Earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saving the world from asteroid strikes has moved out of the realm of science fiction in Russia into a political reality after a spectacular meteor explosion injured over 1,500 people in the Russian Urals in February.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meteor strike over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk raised fears of what could happen if an even larger space body entered the earth&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s atmosphere above an inhabited area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian space agency chief Vladimir Popovkin told a special conference at the Federation Council, the Russian upper house, that Russia was closely following the asteroid Apophis that is due to come close to the Earth in 2036.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to put a &acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;&#732;</SPAN>beacon&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM] on the asteroid Apophis to ascertain its exact orbit and work out what further actions to take with respect to the asteroid&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s approach to the Earth in 2036,&quot; he said quoted by Russian news agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NASA has already said that according to its calculations there is no danger of the asteroid colliding with the Earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popovkin said that an initial state plan to combat threats from space could appear in Russia at the end of 2013 but the first real measures would only be adopted no earlier than 2018-2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not give details on the cost of the programme, although Russian news agencies said previous estimates had been around 58 billion rubles ($1.9 billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official from Russia&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>[TM]s nuclear agency Rosatom told the same conference that taking out an asteroid with a nuclear weapon would require a bomb with a force of at least one megaton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intercepting an asteroid of a span of more than one kilometre would need the use of nuclear material of the power of over a megaton,&quot; said Oleg Shubin, the deputy director of the department of nuclear munitions experiments at Rosatom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a separate scientific task that needs to be solved,&quot; he added</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shubin said that it could not be predicted well in advance when some 50 percent of asteroids and meteors in the tails of comets would be on a collision course with the earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while the probability of an asteroid collision was low it could still happen at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the foreseeable future I cannot see any other danger that would lead -&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>&quot; at the very least -&acirc;<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>&quot; to the disintegration of human civilisation,&quot; Shubin said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUNICH, Germany, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the eve of Wednesday's Champions League last 16, second leg against Arsenal, Bayern Munich's star defender Dante has said the German giants have what it takes to be crowned European champions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bayern are bidding to reach their third Champions League final in four years when they face the Gunners at Munich's Allianz Arena with a 3-1 lead from the first leg and a quarter-final place at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still in only his first season at Bayern since switching from Moenchengladbach last July, Dante -- full name Dante Bonfim Costa Santos -- has been one of the Bundesliga's stand-out performers this season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imposing centre-back has anchored the Munich defence with his confidence on the ball, strength in the air and calm under pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his arrival, Bayern have conceded just 10 goals in their 25 matches so far this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bayern last won silverware in May 2010 but with a 20-point lead in the Bundesliga the current squad want titles and are still in the running to become the first German club to win the league, cup and Champions League treble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gunners of Arsenal come to Munich hunting goals to overturn Bayern's significant first-leg advantage but as favourites to go into Friday's quarter-finals draw, Dante says Munich can go all the way to the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe it does,&quot; he told AFP when asked if Bayern has what it takes to win the Champions League final at London's Wembley stadium on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year, this team almost did it. We are very hungry for titles and we are working very hard to achieve them. It is not easy, of course, but we are striving for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dante sat out Saturday's 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf when Bayern twice came from behind to finish the weekend 20 points clear in the Bundesliga and could win the title as early as April 6 at Eintracht Frankfurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The season is not over yet,&quot; said Dante, with Bayern showing no signs of releasing their iron grip on the German league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, until now it has been great. In the Bundesliga we have a very good advantage and depending on other results we could win it all in three more games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, we also want to win the German Cup and go as far as possible in the Champions League.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dante's performances for Bayern earned him a Brazil call up and first appearance against England at Wembley in last month's 2-1 defeat and has been included in Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad for the upcoming friendlies against Russia and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also wants to be in the squad when Brazil host the 2014 World Cup and despite his relaxed on-field persona -- he has taught Bastian Schweinsteiger the Arrocha dance from his home state of Bahia after scoring goals -- he is fiercly determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a team like Bayern comes calling, you just have to accept it,&quot; said the 29-year-old. &quot;It is one of the best clubs in the world which is always fighting for championships and this is something I can relate to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to win titles, do not like to lose and the Bayern's mentality fits perfect to mine. The World Cup in Brazil would be a dream to play in my home country. Brazil has great players and the fight for a spot will be very difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, if I continue to do a good job here at Bayern and play well in the national team, then I will have a good chance to be part of the World Cup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ex-Barcelona trainer Pep Guardiola takes over as Bayern coach on July 1 and the team are hoping to bring down the curtain on Jupp Heynckes's three years  with titles -- and then Dante would teach Heynckes the steps to the Arrocha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Heynckes is a great coach and it is a pleasure for me to work with him,&quot; said Dante. &quot;If we win these titles, for sure we will celebrate. I hope he can come along and dance with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has moved hundreds of peacekeepers to a troubled state in South Sudan ahead of an expected government offensive against a rebel group, a UN envoy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deployment comes as UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about extrajudicial killings by the South Sudan army and its &quot;reprehensible&quot; downing of a UN helicopter in December, in a report to be discussed by the UN Security Council on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has moved the peacekeepers into Jonglei state, the scene of large-scale massacres ahead of a government operation against fighters loyal to rebel leader David Yau Yau.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are expecting a military operation against David Yau Yau to happen quite soon,&quot; UNMISS chief Hilde Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Norwegian government minister raised fears that civilians could be caught up in the offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the military operations start, as we think they might quite soon, we will have to be present on the ground to protect civilians to the maximum extent possible,&quot; she said at the International Peace Institute on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNMISS has a mandate to protect civilians in South Sudan but does not carry out operations with government forces against rebel forces. &quot;If the perpetrator also is the government's own army we have a challenge on our hands,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has about 5,000 peacekeepers in South Sudan but has had to move available troops to Jonglei because of the new emergency, and Johnson said the mission could not cope with a new crisis in the huge, remote country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Sudan split from Sudan in July 2011 after more than two decades of civil war which left two million dead. But on top of lingering tensions with its arch-rival neighbor, the South Sudan government has had to confront ethnic tensions and rebellions of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being ravaged by war, South Sudan is struggling to stem rising insecurity and transform a rag-tag ex-rebel army into an effective army and police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yau Yau, an ethnic Murle based in Jonglei, launched an uprising last year after losing an election. He pulled out of a government-sponsored disarmament of militant groups while tensions have also risen with the rival Lou Nuer tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates of Yau Yau's following range from several hundred to 5,000 fighters. South Sudan has repeatedly accused Sudan of supplying weapons to Yau Yau, whom the government also blamed for a cattle raid that killed over 100 Lou Nuer in February. The Khartoum government denies providing weapons to Yau Yau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonglei has been the scene of repeated massacres between the Murle and the Lou Nuer, including one in December 2011 when a column of about 8,000 Lou Nuer killed at least 600 from the rival tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said the UN and local leaders had prevented a similar massacre in the same state on January 28 when a column of at least 6,000 fighters was detected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tangled divisions have been complicated by accusations by rights groups that the army has committed killings and other abuses against civilians in Jonglei as it disarms opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations is still investigating the shooting down of one of its helicopters on December 21 by government forces. The four Russian crew members died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban, in a report to the Security Council, called the helicopter attack &quot;deplorable&quot; and &quot;reprehensible&quot;. The government said the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) had believed the helicopter was a Sudanese aircraft delivering weapons to Yau Yau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said restrictions on helicopter movements because of the incident had made &quot;aerial reconnaissance for early warning purposes impossible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban also raised concerns about &quot;extrajudicial killings&quot; and other abuses by the army during its clampdown on militants. These &quot;give rise to serious concerns about the dangers facing civilians during SPLA operations,&quot; said the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An UNMISS human rights investigator was expelled by the government in October.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bhubaneswar, India, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The maiden flight of India's first domestically developed long-range cruise missile was aborted midway on Tuesday after it veered off course, defence scientists said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-stage Nirbhay missile blasted off from the eastern state of Orissa but the test flight was halted prematurely to &quot;ensure coastal safety&quot;, the state-run Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After travelling approximately midway, deviations were observed from its intended course,&quot; spokesman Ravi Gupta said in a statement, which claimed the basic mission objectives from the test firing had been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a range of 1,000 kilometres (620 miles), the subsonic Nirbhay missile is intended to cruise like an aircraft and can be launched from land, sea and air, defence officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surface-to-surface missile is fitted with a turbojet engine and is capable of flying at low altitudes to avoid detection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India already has in its arsenal the supersonic BrahMos missile which it developed jointly with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's test comes less than a year after India successfully launched its nuclear-capable Agni V ballistic missile with a range of more than 5,000 kilometres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indian military views the Agni V missile as a key boost to its regional power aspirations and one that narrows -- albeit slightly -- its huge gap with China's technologically advanced missile systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the shorter-range Agni I and II were mainly developed with India's traditional rival Pakistan in mind, later versions with longer range reflect the shift in India's focus towards China.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOKYO, March 12 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan said Tuesday it had successfully extracted methane hydrate, known as &quot;fire ice&quot;, from its seabed, possibly unlocking many years' worth of gas for the resource-starved country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what they are claiming as a world first, a consortium is drilling for the hydrate, a fossil fuel that looks like ice but consists of very densely-packed methane surrounded by water molecules, one kilometre (3,300 feet) below sea level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solid white substance burns with a pale flame, leaving nothing but water. One cubic metre of it is estimated to contain many times the equivalent volume of methane in gas form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium, led by Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, began initial work in February last year and on Tuesday started a two-week experimental production, an economy, trade and industry ministry official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the world's first offshore experiment producing gas from methane hydrate,&quot; the official said, adding that the team successfully collected methane gas extracted from the half-frozen substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the government-led project, the consortium is to separate methane -- the primary component of natural gas -- from the solid clathrate compound under the seabed using the high pressures available at depth, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A huge layer of methane hydrate containing 1.1 trillion cubic metres (38.5 trillion cubic feet) in natural gas -- equivalent to Japan's consumption of the gas for 11 years -- is believed to lie in the ocean floor off the coast of Shikoku island, western Japan, the officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We aim to establish methane hydrate production technologies for practical use by the fiscal 2018 year&quot; ending March 2019, a consortium official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to consolidate technologies for its commercialisation,&quot; economy, trade and industry minister Toshimitsu Motegi also told a news conference, according to Jiji Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope we can make use of resources surrounding our country as soon as possible by clearing hurdles one by one,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes as resource-poor Japan has struck out in search of new energy supplies after it shut down its stable of nuclear reactors in the wake of 2011's tsunami-sparked nuclear crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan switched off its atomic reactors for safety checks following the disaster that saw a wall of water hit the Fukushima plant, crippling its cooling systems and sending reactors into meltdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only two of the nation's 50 reactors are now operating, with more stringent safety standards and political nervousness in the wake of the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986 keeping the rest out of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has meant energy costs have shot up for Japan as it has been forced to buy pricey fossil-fuel alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle for energy resources in Asia has become a driving force behind many regional disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talks between Japan and China over a disputed gas field in the East China Sea have been stalled amid the worst diplomatic row between the Asian giants in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gas field is northeast of the Tokyo-controlled disputed islands -- called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China -- over which Asia's two largest economies have locked horns for months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The One World international human rights documentary film festival which opens in Bucharest on Tuesday will give special focus to the Holocaust to highlight the devastating consequences of hatred and intolerance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 6th edition of the (One World Romania) festival aims to be an antidote to hatred&quot;, organisers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount of hatred and intolerance per square meter has grown exponentially since the previous edition of One World Romania&quot;, festival director Alexandru Solomon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why we decided to give special focus to the Holocaust which was the most vicious manifestation of hatred in recent history&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Romanian filmmaker Florin Iepan will present as a world premiere his documentary &quot;Odessa&quot; which focuses on one of the largest mass executions of Jews in the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 22,000 Jews were killed in Odessa in 1941 by Romanian-led forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To what extent are my compatriots willing to reflect on this particular episode?&quot;, Iepan wonders as the Holocaust often remained taboo under the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulgaria's parliament admitted only last week for the first time having failed to save over 11,000 Jews from territories under its control in Serbia, Greece and Macedonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the festival's main section &quot;Hatred is bad for your health&quot; will also highlight the discrimination faced by Roma and Vietnamese minorities in a Czech village (On Decency, by Radovan Sibrt) or by homosexuals in Uganda (Call me Kuchu, By Katherine Fairfax Wright and Malika Zouhali-Worral).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also carefully chose six powerful films about people with so-called disabilities in order to raise acceptance in society&quot;, Solomon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 60 documentaries from around the globe will be shown until Sunday in Bucharest in one of the biggest documentary film festivals in eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One World Romania was created under the patronage of late Czech president Vaclav Havel, the icon of the anticommunist movement in many Eastern European countries. A similar festival called One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival is based in Prague and has its annual event from March 4-13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN WELLS, California, March 11 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Federer made quick work of Ivan Dodig on Monday, keeping his Indian Wells title defence on track with a 6-3, 6-1 third-round victory over the 60th-ranked Croatian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federer needed just 61 minutes to seal the victory -- abetted somewhat by Dodig's six double-faults, the last of which came on match point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quick finish may have been a godsend for the Swiss great, who said he &quot;tweaked&quot; his back late in the match.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Federer said he fully expected to be fit enough to continue his pursuit of a first title of 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not too worried,&quot; Federer said. &quot;I have gone through it so many times where you feel a little tweak. You might play next day. Now this time around I have a day off, extra time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From that standpoint I'm not worried at all,&quot; added Federer, who will face compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka for a quarter-final berth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wawrinka ended the challenge of Australian veteran Lleyton Hewitt 6-4, 7-5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Federer downplayed his back trouble, Leonardo Mayer's back injury was bad enough to have the Argentine pulling out of his scheduled third-round match against Rafael Nadal, sending the fifth-seeded Spaniard into the round of 16 by a walkover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That meant Nadal had a chance to rest his troublesome left knee, but cost him more of the match experience he says he needs as he continues his comeback from a seven-month injury layoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former world No. 1, currently ranked fifth, returned in February, reaching one final and winning two titles in three clay-court tournaments in Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is his first hard-court tournament since injury forced him out of the Miami Masters last March. Nadal remained on course for a possible quarter-final showdown with Federer. But first he faces a potentially tough fourth-round clash with red-hot Latvian Ernests Gulbis, who defeated 20th-seeded Italian Andreas Seppi 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gulbis became the first qualifier to win a title this season in Delray Beach and he came through qualifying here as well. Including those qualifiers, he has won 13 competitive matches in 17 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latvian was looking forward to another crack at Nadal, who has beaten him in four prior encounters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the way I play right now, that should make a difference,&quot; Gulbis said. &quot;Of course he's a great player, but I believe -- honestly I believe -- that if I play my best game I can beat him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych also advanced with ease, beating Germany's Florian Mayer 6-4, 6-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berdych lined up a clash with 10th-seeded Frenchman Richard Gasquet, a 6-1, 6-4 winner over Poland's Jerzy Janowicz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Azarenka, the top women's seed in this combined ATP Masters and WTA tournament, got off to a slow start but turned things around for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-0 victory over Belgian Kirsten Flipkens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth-seeded German Angelique Kerber advanced on schedule, as did former US Open champion Samantha Stosur of Australia and former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stosur, seeded seventh, beat China's Peng Shuai 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 while Wozniacki, a former Indian Wells winner, beat Russian Elena Vesnina 6-2, 6-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women, including second-seeded Russian Maria Sharapova and No. 3 Agnieszka Radwanska who advanced on Sunday, will battle for quarter-final berths on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN WELLS, California, March 11 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria Azarenka woke up just in time on Monday, rallying for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-0 victory over Belgian Kirsten Flipkens that kept her Indian Wells WTA title defence on track.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Azarenka remained unbeaten in 2013, having successfully defended her Australian Open title and her WTA Doha crown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 23-year-old from Belarus, currently ranked second in the world behind American Serena Williams, is vying to become the first woman to win back-to-back titles at Indian Wells since Martina Navratilova in 1990 and 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she showed far from dominant form in a scrappy first set against Flipkens, a 27-year-old ranked 31 in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just wanted to go to sleep instead of playing tennis,&quot; Azarenka said of her first-set struggles, which saw her broken three times in the frame after taking a 2-0 lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stuffy nose compounded her problems, and once she'd dealt with that, she said, she began to feel better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just blew my nose, started breathing better and calmed down and started to see what I had to do,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, after she'd held her serve to open the second set she and Flipkens exchanged breaks in the next four games before Azarenka earned the decisive break in the eighth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She served it out with a love game and a demoralized Flipkens had no answer in the third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though it wasn't her best, Azarenka said it was a gratifying victory, one that showed she's maturing as a player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm really happy that I find the ability to turn around my matches no matter what the circumstances are on the court,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's definitely what excites me the most... To know when to take your opportunities, when to do things is definitely a learning experience. I'm glad I'm starting to master that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Azarenka, who next faces unseeded Urszula Radwanska of Poland, led a parade of the top 10 seeds into the women's round of 16 scheduled for Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second-seeded Maria Sharapova, No. 3 Agnieszka Radwanska and fifth-seeded Petra Kvitova had advanced on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 4 Angelique Kerber of German advanced on Monday with a 6-1, 7-6 (7/4) victory over Belgian Yanina Wickmayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventh-seeded Australian Sam Stosur, a former US Open champion, defeated China's Peng Shuai 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 and eighth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki breezed past Russian Elena Vesnina 6-2, 6-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerber had to dig deep in the second set but said words of encouragement from her coach when she trailed 4-1 helped her turn it around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was coming to me and just reminding me of the game plan we had before the match and just telling me to focus on my game, play point by point and believe in my game,&quot; she said. &quot;It helps me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS, March 13 2013</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea have their hearts set on higher things than the Europa League next season as both target Champions League qualification via top four finishes in the English Premier League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both London sides will nevertheless be seeking to book quarter-final berths on Thursday - even if Chelsea will have to do things the hard way after a first leg defeat at Steaua Bucharest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rafael Benitez's men lost 1-0 in Romania but, having recovered from two goals down at Old Trafford to earn an FA Cup replay at the weekend, they will be hoping for a sinmilar comeback at Stamford Bridge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would keep alive Benitez's ambition of putting at least one trophy on the sideboard before leaving in the summer after a difficult time of it as interim coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spurs, on the other hand, appear bound for the last eight after whipping a pale Inter Milan side 3-0 at White Hart Lane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tottenham coach Andre Villas-Boas knows only too well how poisoned is the Chelsea chalice having supped from it himself, only to be fired midway through last season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Portuguese has clearly learned from the experience by bouncing back on the other side of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under his guidance, Spurs, who were denied a place in the Champions League last May by dint of his successor Roberto Di Matteo winning the tournament, have managed to date to keep the Blues at arm's length and currently stand third, two points ahead and seven ahead of North London rivals Arsenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villas-Boas has called on his side to forget the Liverpool loss, which ended a 12-match unbeaten run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Wales star Gareth Bale is suspended for the return to Inter's San Siro, where he hit a hattrick in the Champions League group phase two years ago, Villas-Boas says European glory is there for the taking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a wonderful opportunity to continue in the Europa League,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our rewards can be with the Europa League trophy and Champions League qualification - that is our main ambition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lifting the trophy would see Chelsea complete the set of European Cup, the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup and also UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, a triple achieved to date only by Bayern Munich, Ajax and Juventus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">England's other survivors, Newcastle, would certainly be more than happy with  Europa League success, however maligned the tournament may be compared with the far more lucrative Champions League, where participation itself brings in megabucks as well as far greater kudos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Magpies have not won a trophy since their 1969 win in the Europa League's distant forerunner, the Fairs Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newcastle welcome Russia's Anzhi Makhachkala after a goalless draw in Russia and Pardew says reaching the quarter-finals is eminently achievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have got a real quality team coming on Thursday and our fans are well-educated enough to know that it will be tough for us and we are going to need every one of them in here to make the atmosphere such that we squeeze through,&quot; said coach Alan Pardew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o, Champions League winner with both the Catalan club and Inter Milan, will make his 100th European career appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm as happy as I was when I started this beautiful job,&quot; said the Cameroon star, who has netted 44 European goals to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know we have performed really well so far. The goal is to go as far as possible and why not reach the final,&quot; Eto'o told UEFA.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy's Lazio must meanwhile face Stuttgart behind closed doors following racist behaviour and the setting-off of smoke bombs in their recent 2-0 win over another German side Borussia Moenchengladbach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Italians, 2-0 up from the away leg, progress their fans will also be excluded from the home leg of their quarter-final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europa League last 16 second leg fixtures:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Newcastle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newcastle United (ENG) v Anzhi Makhachkala (RUS) (1st leg 0-0)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian jets bombed rebel forces attempting to recapture a keenly contested district of third city Homs on Monday, as mortar shells slammed into a Damascus neighbourhood killing at least three people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army's retaliation came as Al-Qaeda claimed the killing of 48 Syrian soldiers on Iraqi territory last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the diplomatic front, a top official of Syria's tolerated opposition met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to appeal for key Damascus ally Moscow to relent in its refusal to back calls on President Bashar al-Assad to step down.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Brussels, European Union foreign ministers emerged from talks with UN-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi on the conflict which is about to enter its third year, divided over whether to arm the rebels or push for a political solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels launched a surprise assault on Homs's Baba Amr at dawn on Sunday, hoping to take back the devastated neighbourhood which they lost to Assad's forces last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regime responded with air strikes and shelling, and sent reinforcements to the city which was &quot;completely sealed&quot;, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The army will at all costs hunt down the rebels even if it destroys the neighbourhood,&quot; Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The regime cannot allow them to stay ... because the neighbourhood of Baba Amr is known as an (anti-regime) symbol in the international media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-government newspaper Al-Watan said &quot;the army thwarted an attempt to infiltrate Baba Amr... inflicting an enormous loss of human life and weapons on the armed groups,&quot; which it said included the jihadist Al-Nusra Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regime troops seized Baba Amr from rebels just over a year ago after a bloody month-long siege that left the district in ruins and claimed hundreds of lives, including those of two foreign journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 90 people were killed on Monday in violence across the country, the Observatory said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the capital, rebels launched mortar attacks, killing at least three civilians in the south of Damascus and wounding 28 others, the state-run SANA news agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another four people were wounded in an attack on the Tishrin sports stadium in the city centre during a football match, a sports manager there told AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Brussels, UN envoy Brahimi insisted that &quot;the military solution is out of the question&quot;, speaking after talks with the EU's 27 foreign ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers were sharply divided, with Britain, France and Italy tipping in favour of eventual military aid for the opposition, and Germany and others seeing that as too risky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Geneva, a UN commission of inquiry on Syria called for direct access to the UN Security Council to make the case for referring crimes committed in the war-torn country to the International Criminal Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also said the Damascus regime appeared to be using militias to carry out sometimes sectarian mass killings in Syria, where the UN says more than 70,000 people have been killed in two years of fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Al-Qaeda front group the Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for an attack on a convoy in western Iraq on March 4 that killed 48 Syrian soldiers and nine Iraqi guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soldiers, who were wounded and received treatment in Iraq, were being transported through the western province of Anbar on their way back to Syria when the attack took place, according to the Iraqi defence ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States condemned the attack as a &quot;terrorist&quot; assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any kind of attack like this, any kind of terrorism like this is something that we should condemn,&quot; State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also renewed Washington's concerns about Al-Qaeda and its affiliates &quot;trying to take advantage of the violence and chaos in Syria for their own ends, which are not in keeping with the desires of the Syrian people to live in a just and democratic society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the diplomatic front, Haytham Manna of the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change -- an anti-Assad group tolerated by the regime as it opposes the armed uprising -- said the road to peace runs through Moscow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always said that a peaceful political solution goes through Moscow,&quot; said Manna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia has vetoed three UN resolutions that would have punished the Assad regime for the violence and has said it views pressure on him to step down as undue foreign interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel's chief of staff Benny Gantz warned that &quot;terrorist&quot; groups fighting Assad's regime alongside other insurgents were &quot;becoming stronger&quot; and voiced concern that they could turn on Israel in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in Syria has become exceptionally dangerous. The terrorist organisations are becoming stronger on the ground. Now they are fighting against Assad but in the future they could turn against us,&quot; Gantz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months, there have been several instances of gunfire or mortar shells hitting the Israeli side of the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said the safety of UN observers in the Golan Heights was under &quot;very active review&quot; after a shooting in the hours following the release Saturday of 21 peacekeepers by Syrian rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the weekend there was an incident in which one post came under fire from two unidentified individuals,&quot; he told reporters.</SPAN></P>
