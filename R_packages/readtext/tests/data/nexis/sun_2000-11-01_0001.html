</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SUN SAYS; LEADING ARTICLE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">886 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MICHAEL PORTILLO says he isn't sure about his future in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he doesn't buck his ideas up, he hasn't got a future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once he preened himself as the big cat in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> jungle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, Portillo is a pussy cat lost in his own back yard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A toothless one, at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty-four hours after The Sun gives him a mauling for his lacklustre performance as Shadow Chancellor, Portillo goes weak at the knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He declares he now has no ambition to be leader of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party. And says he no longer enjoys politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All because The Sun spoke its mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, today we're going to give Portillo some more advice:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you can't take the heat, Michael, get out of the kitchen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If your heart isn't in fighting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> then go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you're not totally behind William Hague, then go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But before you do, think very carefully about the consequences for your party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Hague is going to make any dent in Tony Blair's massive majority at the next Election, he needs men like you to be piling in, sleeves rolled up, itching for a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You should be big enough to take an adverse Sun leader, and some well justified criticism from your colleagues, in your stride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Look at the buckletloads we tip over Blair, Hague, Gordon Brown and John Prescott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They don't chuck in the towel. They accept criticism as part of a politician's lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sun supported the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Conservative Party</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through some of its most heroic fights - against Kinnock, against the unions, against the Communist world - so we have a right, as a force for conservatism, to speak our minds on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As things stand, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could lose the next election so comprehensively they may be finished for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No matter what the polls say, the divisions within the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> make their claims to be an alternative government laughable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet this comes at a time when the Blair Government is weak and, to be frank, all at sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are so many open goals for the Opposition to attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet they don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voters have not changed what they want from a good government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Low taxes. Less regulation. Enterprise. Law and order. Family values. An independent sovereign Britain. A United Kingdom. Portillo should ask himself what HE can do to persuade The Sun and the voters to prefer the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories to Labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He must concentrate on the issues and forget all this soul-searching and his self-indulgent, public ego trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of wandering around Spain giving himself Andalusians of grandeur, he should knuckle down and start punching his weight in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In John Major's government, he did a commendable job as Chief Financial Secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He displayed a honed, analytical mind which easily grasped complex issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no doubt then that Portillo thirsted to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader - he told several Editors so. When Major put the leadership to the vote, Portillo installed 16 phone lines at his campaign HQ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curiously, he never put those phones to use. Maybe he calculated that the cleanest way to the top was to wait for Major to lose the 1997 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canny - or cowardly? No one knows. Not even, we suspect, Michael Portillo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Losing his Enfield seat in the Blair landslide was a shattering blow to Portillo's pride. So much so that he set out to re-invent himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He came back in the safest of safe seats - but tolerant, touchy-feely, inclusive, all-embracing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That wasn't the message much of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party wanted to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Portillo wanted to include all those minorities who had never voted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and probably never would.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Portillo persuaded Hague to ditch the one policy with a proven success rate - the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government would take less tax off us than a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one. What has Portillo told us about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spending policies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has failed to shoot down </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claim that there is a Pounds 16billion hole in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hasn't come up with a Big Idea that would attract a single vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor has he managed to land a punch on Gordon Brown. Portillo admits as much in private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are big soft spots on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flank: stealth taxes, fuel tax, pensions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> costs, the burden on business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Portillo gives the Chancellor an easy ride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hasn't proved he's up to the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More heat is turned on his own colleagues than on the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Portillo unwisely allows his pals to dump on those who preach a harder, more traditional </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ann Widdecombe may not fit in with Portillo's view of an inclusive, attractive, politically correct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party but her common sense, down-to-earth opinions strike a huge chord with many Sun readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Portillo must wake up to reality and stop sniffing into his hanky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> need strong people at the helm who can instil in the party faithful - and the voters - a positive feeling of hope and courage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's face it, the way the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stand today Blair shouldn't wait until May to call an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He should do it now - because he could even win with an even bigger majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's not just The Sun's view. A lot of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backbenchers fear for their seats, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Portillo must make his mind up whether he's going to be an asset or a liability to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he's really going to go, he should do it today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when Cockerill went into print after last year's World Cup criticising Woodward's management style, he condemned himself to oblivion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From No1 at No2, he became an outcast. Cockerill admitted England's supremo had told him he was history overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mercy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lesson is, you don't cross Woodward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The player who asks for Woodward's support will get it. If that man then betrays him, he can expect no mercy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which begs the question: What is the real future for the likes of England captain Martin Johnson and former skippers Matt Dawson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jason Leonard, seen as the spokesmen for an England squad who went on strike over money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodward the player was undoubtedly gifted, if a tad rebellious. He played for the Lions and helped England win a Grand Slam 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also took the worst England squad in living history to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa two years ago - through no fault of his. Despite losing all seven games, he backed his players to the hilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So much so that when they checked into an average hotel in Cape Town, he rejected it on the grounds nobody representing England should be treated shabbily. Woodward took them to the most expensive hotel and paid for it with his credit card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It remains a mystery whether Twickenham repaid him - but then he is a businessman, not short of a bob or two and certainly aware of the finer points of finance and negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So when he said he would back his men to the point of walking out if the row was not resolved, the players knew it was a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem is Woodward also said: &quot;I would be appalled if the RFU increased their offer. I have to say it is ground-breaking and I don't understand the players' rejection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was undoubtedly wounded by the whole sordid business and used words such as &quot;betrayal&quot; to illustrate how strongly he felt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodward always has to support his men. Just as he backed Cockerill, he supported Dallaglio when he fought a successful legal action against allegations of drug-taking and dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact the Wasps skipper was one of the players' spokesmen has cut Woody to the bone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Woodward took over three years ago, England players have been better coached, housed, transported, fed and, frankly, cossetted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everything they wanted, that Woodward thought would make English rugby better, he has stamped and screamed for - and won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's why the former Lions and England centre feels so damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would not like to be the England player who pulls a hamstring in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He might find it the smallest terminal injury in the history of sport.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN 83-year-old conman clocked up his 572nd conviction yesterday after posing as a war hero to swindle a woman out of Pounds 2,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charlie Cowden cheated his victim out of the cash by masquerading as a genuine colonel, who was commended for his distinguished service during World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Glaswegian had a card printed making himself out to be former Irish Guardsman JP Kenneally VC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He even had a full set of fake medals made to support the deception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cowden persuaded Iranian-born Khadijeh Khedri, 55, to &quot;loan&quot; him Pounds 2,500, after claiming he couldn't get access to his millions tucked away in deposit boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when she never saw a penny of the cash again she went to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A court heard how Cowden spent a lifetime &quot;living off his dishonest wits&quot; with the first of his convictions dating back to 1939.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Timothy King - who sentenced him to two years probation - said: &quot;You are a thorough rogue who practised deception upon this innocent young lady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You are no gentleman - a man, but by no means a gentleman. You are nothing but an old lag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Old habits die hard and you can't resist the temptation that crime offers you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope to stop your evil ways of targeting and preying on innocent victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disgust</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cowden's record includes a conviction for idling on war department land in 1940, for which he received hard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also got a six-month jail sentence in 1971 for bigamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Courts across the country have sentenced him to a total of 35 years in prison, and he has spent 20 years of his life behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutor Anthony Orhcard told Snaresbrook Crown Court how Cowden befriended his latest victim after meeting at a market stall in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;The defendant told her he was a retired army general who had won the Victoria Cross during World War II.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cowden, of Kilburn, London, asked her to lend him the money after a sustained charm offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday he </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promised</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to mend his ways and shook his head when the judge listed his criminal past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked by Judge King why he was doing so, he said: &quot;I am shaking my head in disgust at myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cowden was ordered to pay his victim Pounds 2,500 compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL NOT BE FOOLED, MR BLAIR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TODAY two Prime Ministers talk to The Sun about the European army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If we have to choose between Maggie Thatcher and Tony Blair, it's no contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The devastating attack on Blair by Baroness Thatcher strikes to the heart of the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By joining the European army, Blair is committing an act of monumental folly, she declares.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She says he is jeopardising our security and threatening to divide and destroy Nato to satisfy his own vanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's exactly the way The Sun sees it, Maggie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baroness Thatcher is the woman who, with her great ally Ronald Reagan, won the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is she talking rubbish, Mr Blair?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is she lying? Is she wild or absurd?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know who we'd trust to defend this country's interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tony Blair and Robin Cook should start treating voters like adults and tell them the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accusing The Sun and other papers of being 'dishonest' and 'absurd' is the oldest trick in the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By rubbishing the messenger, Blair hopes he can draw attention away from our message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It won't work. People aren't daft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We all know what he's up to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criticism of the European army is not a tabloid myth, as Blair implies in his hysterical comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Times and the Daily Telegraph are against it, and they're not tabloids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the left-wing Guardian echoed The Sun's view about the threat to Nato in an editorial which said the European army 'may even one day render Nato redundant.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mind you, the Guardian thinks that would be a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair and Cook say the new force is not a European army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But EU president Romano Prodi said last February: 'If you don't want to call it a European army, don't call it a European army. You can call it Margaret, you call it Mary Ann, you can call it any name.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a force with 100,000 troops, 400 combat aircraft, 100 warships and a full-time command structure is not an army, what the heck is it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his article today, Blair says fighting will remain a job for Nato.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But with the majority of our combat units committed to the European army, and others on United Nations duty, how will he split British forces three ways when Nato needs them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The danger to Britain's vital relationship with America is there in his own words. Europe will only send in its troops when America and Nato choose to stay out, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first time that happens we will be totally at odds with our closest and most important ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair says British troops will only be used when the British Prime Minister says so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hah! Can anyone really imagine Blair wanting to lose face around Europe by saying No?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if he did, wouldn't that then place us 'at the margins of the EU,' as he puts it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair says we wrote nonsense by stating that America and Nato were against the plan for a European army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonsense? The former Nato commander in the Mediterranean, U.S. Admiral Eugene Carroll, and Richard Perle, who may be U.S. Defence Secretary if George W. Bush becomes President, don't see it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If America thought Europe was spending billions to create a strong force which would work inside Nato and help the U.S. to reduce its role as a world troubleshooter, there would indeed be rejoicing in the White House and the Pentagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But none of the EU countries is spending more on its forces. All that will happen with the new army is that already over-stretched resources will be spread even more thinly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Look at Britain's once-mighty three services. Everything is being cannabilised to keep them going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our subs can't go to sea - we're renting German subs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Harriers and Tornados spend more time in pieces in hangars than they do in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our soldiers' guns won't fire if it's cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What happens if we have to rely on the French or the Italians to fight for us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or, God help us, the Belgians?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest insult to the intelligence of the British public is the Prime Minister's insistence - with the support of his fork-tongued Foreign Secretary - that The Sun is making a fuss about nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair has no mandate for committing British forces to a European army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been no debate in Parliament - other than a brief mention in the recent defence review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair never sought approval for it in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1997 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">manifesto,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but that's no surprise, since three years ago he was firmly AGAINST the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know why he's changed his tune. Because having failed to deliver British entry into the disastrous single currency, he's trying to curry favour with the EU another way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When The Sun and other papers object, he accuses us of lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's rich. We'd love to take the Government on in an honest, intelligent debate about Britain's future role in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But all we get from them is smoke, mirrors, spin and distortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They even dare to suggest that anyone with the temerity to question where the EU is heading, is being 'unpatriotic.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair tiptoes through the dictionary and says he wants a Europe that is a superpower, not a superstate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will someone please explain the difference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EU already has its own currency, Parliament, court, passports, flag, anthem, ambassadors abroad - and soon its own army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French President Jacques Chirac says that an integrated European defence and foreign policy is 'a fundamentally political process.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The whole damned EU empire is about politics. Blair must reckon we are all stupid and can't see what is going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the people had the facts on Europe, they would feel much more comfortable about Britain's place in it, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When did the Government ever give us facts on Europe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French PM Lionel Jospin IS honest. He says that 'a decisive step towards building a political Europe' would be the bringing together of its armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And French Defence Minister Alain Richard shoots down Blair's claim that the European army would be a peacekeeping force when he says that it must be able to deal with a 'high intensity crisis' by being able to carry out 'deep strikes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does that sound like peace?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Blair is sure he is right, and The Sun and Maggie Thatcher are wrong, let him display the courage of his convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He can put his plan to join the European army to the vote in a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He could combine it with a vote on joining the single currency, then he would really know what the people of this country want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one asked us if we wanted our fishing industry destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one asked if we wanted European laws imposed on us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one asked us if we wanted to give up our right to say No to the way Europe is heading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past few years, Britain has been betrayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is time to say: No more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain belongs to the people, not the politicians.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TONY BLAIR will force through a law making gay sex legal at 16 instead of the present 18 - even though the House of Lords have rejected it three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PM is determined to bring down the age for equality reasons and will overrule peers with the rarely-used Parliament Act. Your letters flooded in - all critical of Mr Blair's stance. WHY is New </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> devoting so much of its precious parliamentary time worrying about the age of consent for homosexuals?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What with the inevitable &quot;winter crisis&quot; in the NHS, the trains, the floods, petrol and the dreaded euro, I'd have thought that pandering to gays would be the last thing on ministers' minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government should concentrate on things that affect the majority, not the minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIMEE MEEKINGS, Thundersley, Essex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TONY BLAIR has once again shown himself anything but a man of the people as he </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledges</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to force through the law on gay sex at 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems strange that the man who should be occupied with running the country is apparently more interested in forcing through this law where more young boys will be corrupted by predatory males</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs I SHAW, Luton, Beds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHY on earth is Tony Blair so determined to force through a new law on gay sex? Is he trying to please some of his colleagues who are that way inclined?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> E WHITE, Islington, North London</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RIGHT now this country is a mess. We are trying to clean up after the worst floods in memory, the rail network is chaotic, the NHS is in deep trouble and the Eurocrats are trying to take away our power to govern ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet all Tony Blair seems concerned about is trying to make it legal to have gay sex at 16 and bailing out the Dome. Are you sure you have your priorities in order Mr Blair?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WAYNE SKELDING, Barbourne, Worcs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TONY BLAIR should think very carefully before he reduces the gay sex legal age. Even in this so-called enlightened age, many 16-year-olds are still very immature and vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> J R PEARSON, Southwell, Notts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DEFIANT Blair is riding roughshod over the democratic vote to lower the age of consent for gay sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The House of Lords said No, Parliament said No and, if asked, the majority of voters would say No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Tony Blair is determined to have his way. The same as he is determined to have his way on Europe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IF Tony Blair is so keen on this piece of legislation, why didn't he put it in his General Election </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">manifesto?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lords can see this Act for what it is - a licence for predatory men to prey on young boys</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PETER NORTHCOTT, Birmingham</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BLAIR is completely out of touch with voters on the homosexual age of consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just what is it that drives President Blair on this issue and that of repealing Clause 28?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUKE ELLISON, Lymington, Hants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TONY BLAIR was elected by the people to speak for the people. How can he be so bloody minded as to ignore that we just don't want the age of consent lowered from 18 to 16 for homosexuals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law says that you are not an adult until the age of 18. It is also accepted that boys mature less quickly than girls, making them extremely vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A GREAVES, Bracknell, Berks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I AM disgusted with Tony and Cherie Blair. He is determined to force through the Bill on gay sex, while his lawyer wife is trying to free a paedophile on the grounds his human rights have been infringed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What about our children's rights, Mr and Mrs Blair?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs JEAN BURNS, Timperley, Cheshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FIRST it was trying to abolish Clause 28 which forbids the promotion of homosexuality in schools, now the Government wants to reduce the age of gay consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why is New </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so obsessed with promoting gay sex? Has Mr Blair got shares in a pharmaceutical company manufacturing treatments for Aids?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W E, Maidstone, Kent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT is the point of having a House of Lords if Tony Blair is simply going to ignore their majority vote against gay sex at 16 and push the Bill through the Commons?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the third time peers have sensibly refused to lower the age of gay consent to 16, but Blair's stubborn nature is again ruling over common sense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TONY Blair will put his ministers on a war footing tomorrow as he launches </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PM has summoned his entire Cabinet to Chequers for a secret election-planning summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he is set to double the number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> key election </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledges,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promising the public &quot;Ten Commitments.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But behind the scenes Peter Mandelson has launched a veiled euro attack on Gordon Brown - with whom he shares joint charge of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Message</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Blair will kick off with a huge postal crusade. In a letter going out to hundreds of thousands of voters, he says Britain is moving in the right direction thanks to the people who voted for change in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds: &quot;We've taken some tough decisions - and now they are paying off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PM appeared on Channel 4 last night to deliver the same message. And hundreds of thousands of posters are going up hailing achievements of smaller class sizes, a million more jobs, low inflation and more nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All 21 Cabinet ministers are under orders to come up with policies for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new election </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Details will be thrashed out at the PM's country retreat tomorrow, along with ideas for the next </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">manifesto as Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> draws up a blueprint for winning a historic second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government will go into the next election boasting that the five </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promises</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made in 1997 have easily been met. And they will vow sweeping changes in health, education, transport, the economy and welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One senior </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> figure said: &quot;We need to show momentum. It's a crucial meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit at the PM's Buckinghamshire home will be a test of relations between sworn enemies Mr Mandelson and Mr Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ulster Secretary Mandy shattered the fragile Cabinet truce over the euro by saying the Government had made a mistake by putting the issue to sleep ahead of the Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said ministers should instead be out blitzing the 70 per cent of voters against scrapping the Pound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to bosses at a private dinner he huffed: &quot;It is essential to pave the way for a referendum.&quot; His remarks are certain to infuriate the Chancellor, who convinced Tony Blair that talk of ditching Sterling would dent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The House of Lords threw out moves to lower the age of consent for gays from 18 by 205 votes to 144, a majority of 61.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She added: &quot;It is a constitutional outrage to use the Parliament Act on a moral issue which is subject to a free vote in both Houses and opposed by the overwhelming majority of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Parliament Act was intended for matters of great national constitutional importance, not for gay rights.&quot; Opponents warned the move to lower the age of consent for gay sex will expose thousands of teenage boys to the danger of Aids and cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they insisted it will lead to 16-year-old girls being exposed legally to the same risks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leader of the Lords Baroness Jay said last week: &quot;This will become law one way or another by the end of this session.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baroness Young put forward amendments to the Bill last night, allowing 16-year-olds to indulge in certain sexual acts but not buggery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She told Peers: &quot;Sixteen-year-olds are children in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By keeping the age of buggery at 18, we protect young 16-year-olds from the most dangerous of sexual practices, mainly anal sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have had many letters from doctors about the great dangers to teenagers of this sexual practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But leaving aside what doctors may have said, the Blood Transfusion Service says that no-one who has ever had anal sex is ever allowed to give blood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr McLeish unveiled the new Children's Change Fund as he launched the Executive's first social justice report in Glasgow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The annual report card marking the Executive's progress on key targets showed that 70,000 youngsters in Scotland have been lifted out of poverty since 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the report claims the Executive is on track for full employment, dignity in old age and an end to child poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing the cash would be available from the year after next, Mr McLeish said: &quot;Last year we set out our strategy for tackling poverty and injustice and we committed ourselves to ambitious goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This first annual report shows we are now moving from strategy to action - and action that is making a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FOUR million middle-income earners are to pay an extra Pounds 200 a year in stealth tax under measures finalised in the mini-Budget, it was revealed last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People earning more than Pounds 29,900 a year will be hit by Pounds 200 rises in their National Insurance contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move - which will raise Pounds 200million for Treasury coffers - was confirmed in the fine print of Wednesday's pre-Budget report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sneaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And last night </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accused Chancellor Gordon Brown of sneaking the measure through without workers noticing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo said: &quot;This is yet another stealth tax which will make people such as senior nurses and experienced teachers around Pounds 200 a year worse off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As with Gordon Brown's statements, a tax rise which he didn't announce has appeared in the small print.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Middle and high earners will be hit by the new tax in April next year following an inflation-busting leap in the upper limit for National Insurance contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Details of the scheme were first mentioned in the March 1999 Budget - but went unnoticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They only emerged yesterday in the small print of a Treasury document published along with Mr Brown's mini-Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paymaster General Dawn Primarolo announced the measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move will infuriate millions of hard-working professionals who backed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1997 because of Tony Blair's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promise</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not to raise personal taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have already been hit by the end of the Pounds 200-a-year married couples' allowance and the scrapping of tax relief on mortgage interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> senior ministers believe their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not to increase personal taxes is one of their most important vote-winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Treasury officials last night insisted that four times as many workers will benefit from a rise in the starting limit for National Insurance contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Better</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said 16 million will be better off as a result of the personal allowance rising by 3.4 per cent to Pounds 4,535.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they urged middle income families to wait for the Government's new child tax credit, due to be paid next April, which will increase incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But John Whiting, a tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: &quot;The Government has been quiet about raising the upper limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a type of stealth tax - because not many people realise it's happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Brown has been accused of raking in billions from a series of stealth taxes - measures which are often not spotted or go unnoticed by consumers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE deadlock in America has given Tony Blair and Gordon Brown a real scare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even eight years of economic boom was not an automatic guarantee of re election for the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al Gore could not convince voters that he and Bill Clinton deserved all the credit for America's prosperity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is the same challenge Blair and Brown face - but which Brown tackled yesterday with a masterly performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the U.S., people know Federal Reserve boss Alan Greenspan masterminded the good times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Britain, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bold decision to give the Bank of England control over interest rates helped them build on the solid legacy left them by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America's near deadheat shows Blair that no politician can ever take the people for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's why Brown's mini-Budget was so important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has surely taken the heat out of the fuel protest and must believe he has paved the way for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> second term in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More money for pensioners, schools and poorer families is good news for millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's a pity motorists must wait until April before cheaper &quot;green&quot; fuel appears at the pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But by cutting the cost of taxing their cars for five million drivers, Brown cleverly destroyed one of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> big election hopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promised</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a cut of three pence a litre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown's measures are worth the equivalent of FOUR pence a litre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he's bought off the truckers with vehicle tax cuts to match the lowest in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown denies his hand has been forced by public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But after the uproar over the 75p pension rise in the last Budget, he's now giving single pensioners Pounds 5 a week next year and Pounds 8 for married couples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plus the Pounds 200 cheque in the post from next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U-turn or a listening Chancellor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's for voters to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What they will want to see from Blair and Brown are the radical reforms they boasted of in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Improved teaching standards. Private money to transform the health service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A big axe on welfare handouts to scroungers. And a guarantee that extra billions pumped into public services will be well spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are the same problems Gore faced against a tough opponent like Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair must be thankful that he'll get an easier ride from the lacklustre </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the leaks are true - and we'll be amazed if they're not - the Chancellor will deliver an intelligent package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is giving more money to pensioners, not back to motorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And according to the polls, most people think that's right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We still believe Brown should be cutting fuel duty today. That would show that the Government listens and understands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But with a six point lead in the polls over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown and Blair may say: Why worry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's becoming more and more clear that, barring a sensational upset, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tories</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> haven't a hope of winning the Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Hague's aim must be to get Blair's majority down to less than a hundred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory promise</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to cut 3p off fuel tax might be the weapon to achieve that.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WITH just a week to go until the petrol protesters' deadline for Government action, PM Tony Blair is still standing strong in his refusal to slash fuel duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has said that a large tax cut would affect pensioners, the economy and the public services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Home Secretary Jack Straw fuelled more petrol panic-buying by urging people to fill up now in preparation for more blockades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Sun readers are not impressed with the Government's stance. Most want a sizeable cut in petrol prices. I FEAR Tony Blair is indulging in brinkmanship in warning hauliers and farmers not to set up new petrol blockades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He quotes all the hardships it will cause but they could easily be avoided if Blair insisted Gordon Brown reduces the fuel tax by dipping into his bulging coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then national unity would be peacefully maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ROBERT HIGTON, Gedling, Notts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WE keep hearing that cutting fuel tax would mean losing on pensions, schools and hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right, but when did Tony Blair say in the last election that petrol would cost more because of them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> R CARTER, Folkestone, Kent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TONY Blair's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promises</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are like piecrusts - easily broken. He </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promised</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a decent rise to the elderly, yet again they are to be brushed aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To use the much-needed rise as an excuse not to drop fuel prices is despicable and cowardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Come on Mr Blair - try keeping at least one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promise</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs D REDDEN, Castleford, West Yorks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCORDING to an interview I heard, if petrol taxes were cut we would would lose vast numbers of nurses, doctors, and schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Isn't it odd that we would never lose any civil servants?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor, I suspect - to take an example of Government spending - would we lose fig trees at that new parliamentary building for MPs, Portcullis House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALEX SWANSON, Milton Keynes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Government must cut petrol prices in the mini-budget by a reasonable level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We don't expect massive cuts, just enough to show that they admit they've made a mistake and they listen to public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country won't accept empty gestures, only constructive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MARK WHITEMAN, Maesteg, Mid Glamorgan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YOU'VE got to admire Tony Blair's nerve, if nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How does he dare say that fuel protesters have no right to bring the country to a standstill when the sheer greed of his own Government is the cause of the problem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He applauds people who stand up to dictators in other countries, but when we do it here, he treats us like something he's stepped in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People hate being taken for mugs, and it's the ultimate insult to expect us all to keep paying extra cash on a Government whim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> G REDMOND, Newquay, Cornwall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHILE I fully support the need for a cut in fuel prices, I could not support any protest action that would harm our economy and people, such as blocking food depots. Help for farmers and road hauliers is a must, they are our nation's life blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for the rest of us, a 2p cut in the price per litre and a Pounds 10 cut in the rip-off road tax across the board would go a long way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> J M, Lancing, West Sussex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONCE again New </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has scored an own goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By telling everyone to keep their petrol tanks topped up, they have caused queues at the pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surely someone in the Cabinet realised that would happen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as for bringing in the Army to keep things moving, that too will provoke a bad situation and make things worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WE BARNEY, Springbourne, Dorset</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OF course the Chancellor isn't going to budge on petrol tax until the very last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gordon Brown is well known for his prudence and it makes common sense to take as much money as possible up to the 60-day deadline set by protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wouldn't be surprised if he includes fuel in his mini-budget at the last moment to prevent &quot;Armageddon&quot; before Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs ANDREA PEELE, Kettering, Northants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PETROL companies say demands for fuel have increased 75 per cent since Jack Straw last week advised drivers and essential services to fill up before the next blockade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Did the Home Secretary honestly believe the ordinary motorist would ignore his statement? If he did, it proves he is irresponsible and shows how far removed the Government are from the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ERNEST MUNDY, Buckhurst Hill, Essex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT'S time for this Government to get their priorities right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are more worried about troops delivering fuel than sending them to help people who have had their homes and businesses destroyed by the floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> C BISHOP, Hornchurch, Essex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THERE has been a certain amount of criticism over the present panic-buying by motorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when you look at the cause, reasons and alternative transport available, it leaves many of us little choice but to get it while we can!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> D CAREY, Edmonton, North London</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MOST of the nation want to see a cut in the crippling fuel tax but Tony Blair is hell-bent on confrontation with protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any protest will be a people's protest and he will put himself in a no-win situation if he uses the Army to smash picket lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blair may get the petrol through but he will be dumped at the ballot box at the next election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs B TAYLOR, St Helens, Merseyside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JACK Straw was irresponsible in urging people to fill up with petrol now. That kind of talk led to panic during the last fuel crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government should look at ways of cutting petrol tax instead of fuelling people's fears.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DEFIANT John Prescott yesterday challenged motorists to boot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> out if they don't like this week's mini Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deputy PM reminded them they can dump the Government at the polls over the cost of petrol.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was advanced warning of a keynote speech today by Gordon Brown in which the Chancellor will kill off all hopes of a cut in fuel duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Prescott said: &quot;Government must govern. The Prime Minister has made that clear - and at the end of the day we will be accountable to the electorate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was backed by Tony Blair, who shrugged off claims he was out of touch with voters over petrol costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PM insisted cutting fuel tax would lead to higher mortgages by triggering inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Brown has drawn up a Pounds 1billion package aimed at cutting the costs of the haulage industry and farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hopes it will stop them bringing the country to a standstill with protests after Wednesday's pre-Budget report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cost of tax discs will fall for some trucks. And foreign lorry drivers will be charged Pounds 1,500 for a licence to work in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Brown will warn business leaders at the CBI conference today that giving in to fuel protests will smash his hopes of matching the performance of world-beating U.S. firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supplies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night petrol supplies in Scotland were returning to normal after a wave of panic-buying died down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And protest leaders who helped halt fuel supplies leaving the Grangemouth refinery </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledged</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not to repeat the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haulier Robbie Burns, 44, said: &quot;The way to take action is democratically - at the ballot box.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many rounded on Home Secretary Jack Straw following his advice to motorists to &quot;fill up now&quot; on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stir</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His comment triggered panic buying at petrol stations ahead of the protesters' deadline for renewed action on November 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despatch manager Bill McKinlay, 45, from NAIRN, said: &quot;I think Jack Straw and Tony Blair are just spoiling for a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The comments they have been making over the past few days have been pretty inflammatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And by bringing in the police and troops it gives the impression they are prepared to fight it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scott Sutherland, 28, from INVERNESS, reckons drivers should stop panic buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water board worker Scott said: &quot;People are stocking up when there is no problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm not worried at the moment because even the protest leaders say there's no need to panic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hairdresser Sharon Forrester, 30, is 100 per cent behind the fuel protesters. Sharon, of FALKIRK, said: &quot;It should go ahead. The country should be run like a business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If one government does not make a job of it, they should give somebody else a chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allan, 44, of FIFE, said: &quot;It's ridiculous that we are an oil-producing country, yet petrol's so dear. When you go to Spain, which has no oil, you pay just 44p a litre.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gus, 47, said: &quot;We are the only EU country producing oil, but we pay the highest prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the Government can't work out what's wrong and do something about it, out with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Jack Straw lectures us about it all. He is the man caught driving at 103mph and who gets his son off a drugs charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McConnell axes SQA boss over report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JACK McCONNELL yesterday sacked the chairman of the Scottish Qualifications Authority and vowed to set up a new &quot;early warning system&quot; to prevent another exams fiasco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Education Minister also accepted the resignations of the other 23 board members after the publication of a report into the crisis which hit thousands of schoolkids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some will be allowed to stay in their posts to keep the SQA running. Chairman David Miller will be replaced by Scottish Homes boss John Ward who is under orders to provide a recovery plan within a fortnight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report, by Deloitte and Touche, blamed &quot;management weakness&quot; for last summer's blunders. Mr McConnell </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promised</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;immediate and comprehensive action&quot; to prevent a repeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;The problems highlighted by this report simply cannot happen again next year. We must restore confidence and put in place a means of monitoring progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The report paints a stark picture of an organisation with significant management weaknesses, where poor planning led to a crisis from which it could not recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;None of this was a surprise. However, after reading the report, I was appalled by the scale of the organisational failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr McConnell said: &quot;My top priority is to ensure that next year's exam results are accurate and on time. The young people of Scotland deserve the best. We will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the SQA make that a reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of youngsters were given incomplete, late or wrong results for their Scottish Standard Grade exams and for the new system of Higher exams in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SQA's chief executive Ron Tuck, resigned soon after the crisis broke and two other senior figures also left. Mr Tuck was replaced by Bill Morton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr McConnell said: &quot;The remit I have given Mr Morton is to put in place the systems, the people and the organisation that can deliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He can step on any toes he wants anywhere in Scotland to deliver that and he will have my backing. That will go for Mr Ward as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But teachers' union leader, Derek Kennedy, insisted the blame for the exam crisis went beyond the SQA board. The NASUWT president said it was &quot;important that a number of people who clearly have a responsibility leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that it was &quot;very significant&quot; that the report had listed as a cause of the crisis the fact that the SQA did not have detailed information about the Higher Still requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;It looks as if the SQA was experiencing the same kind of difficulties that teachers have had and if that is so then quite clearly responsibility goes beyond the SQA and must focus on the Higher Still development unit and the role of the inspectorate as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Signal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scottish </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Tory</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> education spokesman Brian Monteith said the resignations sent out a strong signal to pupils, teachers and parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;What Sam Galbraith failed to do in a couple of months Jack McConnell has done in a couple of days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lib Dems counterpart Jamie Stone said: &quot;The board of the SQA have clearly failed in their responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From the initial information that Higher results would be late to the recent revelations surrounding the non-urgent appeals, the reputation of Scottish education has taken a battering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is now up to the new chairman of the SQA to restore that reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The scenes we have witnessed cannot be allowed to be repeated and the new chairman must ensure that they never are.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE entire board of the Scottish Qualifications Authority faces the axe today with the publication of a report on this summer's exams fiasco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First Minister Henry McLeish yesterday </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">promised</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;tough action&quot; to ensure there is no repeat of the crisis which hit thousands of youngsters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this week, red-faced officials had to admit dozens of exam appeals are still not complete and angry Education Minister Jack McConnell admitted his patience has snapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, Mr McLeish said: &quot;There will be a full discussion but, when the dust settles, we have a single purpose to move on from here. This fiasco should never, ever happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jack McConnell can't sack the SQA board, but he can ask them to resign and he's expected to act after the publication of a report by consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">SNP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> education spokesman Mike Russell backed the shake-up plan last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to Mr McConnell, he said: &quot;I do not think it is feasible for the board to remain in office any longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE chief inspector of English schools, Chris Woodhead, 53, quit last night after a six-year reign as the scourge of bad teachers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">LABOUR</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bosses have agreed a secret deal to allow rebel MP Dennis Canavan back into the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will blame a faulty selection procedure for blocking him from standing as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidate in Falkirk at the Scottish elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Canavan, above, WILL reapply to join the party after accepting the deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under normal rules, anyone booted out is barred from rejoining for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a party insider said last night: &quot;These are special circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Canavan's feud with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> started when his Falkirk West constituency humiliated party leaders at a pre-devolution conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They put down a motion slamming Gordon Brown's plans to cut single parent benefit as &quot;economically inept, morally repugnant and spiritually bereft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they were backed by rank-and-file members despite an all-out attack by party bosses. Every member of the constituency party was later barred from the Scottish Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was the start of a rift between Mr Canavan and late First Minister Donald Dewar, who branded him &quot;not good enough&quot; for the Scottish Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The maverick MP was kicked out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when he defied party chiefs by standing as an independent in Falkirk West - winning a seat at Holyrood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has called a press conference for today to discuss &quot;the possibility of rejoining the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But last night it was clear the rebel has accepted the deal from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bosses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friends in Parliament confirmed an offer is on the table. One said: &quot;He's definitely got a deal. The question was whether he was going to accept it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key bargaining counter is Mr Canavan's threat to quit his Westminster seat and force a by-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A month ago he announced he was to stand down - and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledged</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to resign by last Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he made it clear he wants to rejoin </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and revealed party leaders have been trying to prevent a by-election in Falkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is confident of winning the two by-elections in Mr Dewar's Anniesland seats, Falkirk is much more dangerous for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week Mr Canavan made another appeal for reconciliation. He told Parliament: &quot;If I had still been a member of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labour</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party I might have ended up voting for Henry McLeish.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drug dealers will still appear before traditional courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Executive source said: &quot;One of the key things is to try to break the cycle of court-prison-out and back to court.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">SNP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leader John Swinney yesterday vowed to defy an EU ruling which will ban number plates displaying the Saltire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He declared: &quot;If it's a crime to be proud of your country, then I plead guilty.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We revealed yesterday that the letters SCO and the Saltire will be outlawed from reg plates from September 2001. The only flag allowed will be the European Stars symbol. Drivers repeatedly caught with illegal plates could be fined Pounds 1,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Swinney vowed to put a Saltire on his Peugeot 206 just like his predecessor Alex Salmond did on his Ford Scorpio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Popular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;Anybody driving on Scottish roads knows how popular these plates have become in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's a sign of a growing sense of Scottish identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Is that why the Government is acting to clamp down on them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't have a set of Scottish number plates but I'm going to get one now and if they want to start prosecuting ordinary Scottish drivers, they can start with me!&quot; Scottish Sun readers also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">pledged</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to buy up new SCO plates for their motors to defy the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mini skip hire boss Bill Thomson, from Stirling, raged: &quot;I have three lorries and a car and I am going out now to get them all fitted with the Saltire plates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am fed up with the EU and its silly ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George O'Hara, of Glasgow-based Prestige Number Plates, said: &quot;What's spewing out of Brussels is absolute nonsense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
