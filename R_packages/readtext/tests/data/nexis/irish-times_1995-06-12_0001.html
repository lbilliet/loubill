</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHELLS and rockets blasted Sarajevo yesterday as casualties mounted on both sides of front lines in the wake of a fierce Bosnian government assault on positions above the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two huge blasts rocked the centre and a shell hit the city's main hospital, killing two patients in their beds as Muslim led Bosnian government forces appeared to win control of a key Serb supply route overlooking the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separatist Serb forces denied the government had cut the road linking their headquarters at Pale to the important barracks of Lukavica south of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two patients died and three others were injured when a shell slammed into the infectious diseases clinic at Sarajevo's Kosevo hospital. UN officials said besieging Bosnian Serbs had launched two large rockets of an unknown type on the city, flattening a building near the office of the Bosnian President, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, and rows of garages near the city's Miljacka river.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City morgue officials said that by late afternoon they had received 15 fatalities, at least six of them government army soldiers. Health workers said there were 11 wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serbs in the western Serb held suburb of Hadzici said five civilians had been killed in fierce government shelling of the town, which lies on the periphery of the Serb siege ring of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bosnian Serbs are loath to give casualty figures but an adviser to the Bosnian Serb leader, Dr Radovan Karadzic, spoke in a statement of large scale attacks on civilian and military targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hospital reports suggest that over 50 per cent of our casualties are civilian,&quot; he said, denying the Serbs had lost any ground to their Muslim foes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters in Pale saw military casualties arriving at hospitals but were not permitted to visit wards. The streets were deserted, with most men dispatched to front lines and Pale radio playing rousing Serb songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists were also refused entry to hospitals in Sarajevo by Bosnian police as military casualties arrived in fleets of camouflaged ambulances and small vans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the unprecedented rocket attacks and the shellfire were the expected Bosnian Serb response to attempts by the Bosnian army to cut Serb supply routes as a first step to breaking the three year siege of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy fighting had broken out around the city at dawn after a day of fighting in hills to the northwest. Intense small arms machine gun, mortar and tank fire ripped through the hills, with both sides using weapons seize back from UN storage depots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy machine gun and small arms fire could be heard on the Debelo Brdo hill south of the city late in the morning, indicating a stiff infantry battle was in progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian Serbs used French light tanks stolen three weeks ago when they overran UN weapons depots to fire on government positions and Bosnian soldiers replied with mortar and artillery fire, a UN spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN sources said government troops had also entered a UN weapons depot in the centre of Sarajevo and withdrawn &quot;about 70 per cent&quot; of the 42 mortars and artillery pieces stored there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFP adds: The United States strongly supports the British and French led rapid reaction force in Bosnia, President Clinton told a news conference at the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Halifax Canada, yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will have the mission of preserving the integrity of the UN force&quot; in Bosnia Herzegovina, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton said the United States should pay a share of the cost of setting up the crack military force and pledged to work hard to convince Congress to set aside funds for that purpose. I will support that and do my dead level best to argue my case in Congress,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This rapid reaction force gives these countries the powers that they have lacked to protect their troops and to preserve the honour of their country and to pursue the UN mission in a way they have not been able to since they have become more vulnerable to being taken hostages,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bosnian crisis has dominated talks among G7 leaders, who issued a statement late on Thursday urging restraint and a moratorium on military operations to allow for peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Jean Chretien, said the Bosnian army had moved heavy weapons near UN posts around Sarajevo, heightening concerns about the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said fighting in Bosnia had left four French soldiers injured with some 40 others - French and Canadian - unable to return to their positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is severe shelling of Sarajevo,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE hundred and sixty disabled anglers from all over Ireland are expected to participate in a competition sponsored by the Bank of Ireland this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each county will be represented by five anglers, and numerous heats are planned on Sunday mornings from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the National Disabled Angling Facility (NDAF) in Aughrim, Co Wicklow. A grand finale to determine the lucky winning team will take place in October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teams will compete for a perpetual trophy by the Irish sculptor, Linda Brunker. In addition, each winning team member will receive a silver badge and a cheque for Pounds 100. A bronze badge by the same sculptor and a cheque for Pounds 50 will be presented to the runners up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend I witnessed the splendour of this magnificent facility. Located in the heart of the Garden of Ireland, the eight acre park is surrounded by a profusion of plant life and contains a fully stocked four acre lake. The development is a community initiative, part funded by the LEADER Programme and supported by FAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first round of competitions got under way last Sunday, and Waterford emerged as clear winners over Laois and Westmeath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross Border co operation received a further boost last week following the commissioning of a protection vessel aimed at safeguarding salmon stocks in the Foyle catchment area. At a cost of Pounds 325,000, the new 43 foot boat will enhance the Commission's capability to, protect the run of salmon which can reach 80,000 each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funded by the fishery departments, North and South, with the European Union, the investment forms part of an overall plan announced by the two governments last December. The Foyle Fisheries Commission is a statutory body, established in 1952 under parallel legislation and whose primary function is the conservation, protection and improvement of salmon and inland fisheries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by the University of Aberdeen has shown that seals are not responsible for the decline in salmon and cod stocks in Scotland's coastal waters, according to the newsletter Naturopa from the Council of Europe. For years fishermen maintained that seals were responsible and called upon the government to cull them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six year study shows that the common seal eats mainly herring and sprat in the winter and sand eel and octopus in the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trout anglers at Emy Lough in Co Monaghan are at present enjoying good fishing. Over the week, 58 anglers took 55 fish weighing 84lb.  Pat Fay from Lisburn caught a wild brown trout of 3 3/4lb on an Invicta fly. Other good flies were Mayfly patters, Bibbio and Claret Bumble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The season on Creevy Lake at Carrickmacross opened on June 4th, and most anglers took their bag limit of tour fish. Loughs Nagarnaman and Baithe are due to open on June 18th. Permits are available from the local angling club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board will hold a game angling school for beginners at Ballinlough on Saturday, July 1st. Further details are available from John Ryan at (0907) 40103.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NORMAL working will resume at An Post on Monday. A meeting of GPO and savings bank workers yesterday approved an ICTU package to end the month old dispute.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations on outstanding issues will now resume at the Labour Relations Commission with a deadline of July 14th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 170 members of the Civil and Public Service Union had been suspended since the start of a work to rule last month. The dispute centred on An Post's refusal to pay a 3 per cent optional increase allowed for under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress. Changes in working hours and conditions were also at issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICTU intervened in the dispute earlier this week and proposals worked out with the deputy general secretary of Congress, Mr Kevin Duffy, were approved by the CPSU branch committee on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's general branch meeting voted by about 300 to 50 to accept the nine point package, which suspends a proposed increase in working hours, and changes in the flexitime scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On their return to work, CPSU staff will receive a lump sum of six months retrospective payment of the PESP increase, while the union is free to pursue further retrospection in the resumed talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debate on the outstanding questions will now continue at the Labour Relations Commission, and if there is no agreement by July 14th, the issues will go before a special tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CPSU's general secretary, Mr Blair Horan, said An Post had been forced to modify its position on key issues in the dispute. He said the company had to adopt a more realistic approach based on its current financial health, and not on the loss making position it was in three years ago when the cost cutting package was first mooted.</SPAN></P>

Mark Lawson watched the case unfold</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DOWN the middle of the lobby of the Royal Courts of Justice in the antique display cases catalogue the business of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them holds a list of the latest divorces: couples with the same surname now bleakly divided by a &quot;v&quot;. Listed for Court 13, under the jurisdiction of Mr Justice Morland, was a case officially billed as being between Graeme James Souness and Mirror Group Newspapers, the former alleging libel in a newspaper, the Sunday People, owned by the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the matter before the court was really Souness v Souness, an unusual, unofficial extension - available only to the rich - of divorce hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are not matrimonial proceedings,&quot; the judge reminded all parties on Monday. But, sitting in Court 13, it was often hard to remember this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain in recent years, there have been celebrity libel cases.  (Archer and the Daily Star). There have been political libel cases (Meacher and the Observer). There have been journalistic libel cases (Worsthorne and Neil). There have been historical libel cases (Tolstoy and Aldington).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this, as far as anyone could remember, was the first marital libel case. It touched on other subjects as well - principally, football and money - but it was at heart the story of a marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Graeme Souness and Danielle Wilson met in the late 1970s he was at the beginning of what would become one of the most successful careers in modern football. A midfielder for Middlesborough (transferred from Tottenham Hotspur, where he started), he had also begun to play for Scotland, which would lead to 54 international caps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time their first son, Fraser, was born in May 1980 Souness was at Liverpool FC, where he became captain of what his counsel, Lord Williams, described in court on Tuesday as &quot;the most successful football team there has ever been&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a majority of what has been said by either side in court has been disputed by the other, no one objected to this claim. In six years at Liverpool, Souness won five League Championship medals, three European Cup Winners' Cup medals and four League Cup medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a manager, he coached Glasgow Rangers to four Scottish League Championships in five years, and Liverpool - in three turbulent years which stand as the only relative failure in his career - to the FA Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This success brought vast financial reward. Danielle Souness told the court this week that her former husband had, spoken more than once of having Pounds 8,000,000 in the bank&quot;. (He put his worth at considerably less.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the marriage was less successful. Graeme and Danielle Souness separated in November 1988 and were divorced last year. This High Court extension of their dispute related to an article published on May 9th, 1993, in the Sunday People, based on an interview with Danielle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article alleged that Souness had behaved like a &quot;dirty rat&quot; towards his wife and family by attempting to evict them from the family home and telling his exwife to &quot;get stuffed&quot; when she sought money from him to support the children. Mirror Group Newspapers, publishers of the Sunday People, denied libel and claimed the article was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Court 13, the rival teams of clients and solicitors sat side by side on benches at the front of the court. It was hard, watching this particular case, not to think of the adjacent managers dug outs beside a football pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, during the evidence of Danielle Souness this week, a particular touchline scene from her husband's career kept coming to mind: the 1992 FA Cup Final, when Souness, only just back at work after triple by pass heart surgery, was under medical instruction not to get too excited, and the Liverpool FC club doctor sat beside him to make sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting on the bench at the front of Court 13, listening to Danielle's portrait of their former marriage, he was tinder legal instruction not to get excited, and it was Karen Souness who played the role of the club doctor, whispering soothingly in his ear, twice grasping his hand, as the first Mrs Souness gave her evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Justice Morland refereed strictly. At one point he verbally yellow carded Mr Souness and the People team's QC, Mr George Carman, for degenerating into argument&quot;, during the defence's cross examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also displayed something of an obsession with deportment in court. Neither journalists nor the public were permitted to stand.  Overflow press had to sit on the steps of the witness box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is thought that Mr Justice Morland may have been influenced by the celebrated report of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, on all seater stadiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF ANY of the jury of 10 men and two women had ever had the experience of a marriage breaking up among their friends - contending accusations being made in alternating telephone calls - then this trial would be an eerily familiar experience for them. In essence, what they heard was two different versions of the same marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danielle Souness told the court of a relationship that, from &quot;pride&quot; in her husband's footballing fame and success, degenerated into behaviour that made her feel &quot;physically sick&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her husband had tried to persuade her to sign a tenancy agreement on the 17th century farmhouse in Surrey where she lived after the separation with their sons, Jordan and Fraser, and Chantelle, the daughter from Mrs Souness's first marriage whom the footballer had legally adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Souness said that a condition of one draft tenancy agreement had been that, under threat of eviction, nobody apart from family members would be allowed to stay in the house for more than two consecutive nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she declined to agree to her husband's terms for occupancy, she told the court, she had received a letter from solicitors instructing her to vacate the house by a few days before Christmas 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, she had been forced to sell jewellery to raise money. Finally, she alleged Souness had begun legal moves to commit her to prison if she failed to complete a questionnaire as part of their divorce proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The husband had a different version of events. The legal threats had been merely a tactic to &quot;focus her mind&quot; on the tenancy agreement. The restrictions on visitors to the house had been because &quot;I didn't want to bump into a new boyfriend when I was visiting my children&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had known nothing of her sales of jewellery. The moves to commit his wife to prison had been &quot;on my lawyer's advice&quot;. In general, however, he believed that no one can challenge me about being a good father or good husband. I am extremely proud of being a good father and good husband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the tradition of British libel actions, this trial provided its share of high class theatre. The primary excitement was provided by the close proximity of the two Mrs Sounesses, an encounter which society would in general be constructed to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danielle Souness and Karen Souness are both blondes - although dark roots suggest peroxide in both cases - and both wear their hair to an identical length flicked off the shoulders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only difference between the two is that Karen is thinner and a younger model, both chronologically - 35 to the first wife's 39 - and actually, for she used to make a living on the cat walk. In court Danielle never looked at Karen, but the second Mrs Souness stared at the first with cold eyes throughout Danielle's two days in the witness box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sartorially, the first Mrs Souness tended to make changes of blouse within the same out fit of black jacket, fawn trousers and brown cowboy boots, while the second Mrs Souness switched her strip as often as Manchester United. On Monday, she wore a navy blue trouser suit with silver buttons; on Tuesday, a lemon suit. Mr Souness favoured black suits and sober ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS WELL as husband versus wife and first wife versus second wife, the legal fixture featured an other fascinating contest: the battle in the midfield of Court 13 between Lord Williams and George Carman, two of the big fee legal strikers of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Williams seemed the sharper. The Welsh accent has always been suited to the suggestion of menace - witness the careers of Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins - and Lord Williams sounded very much in this tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing with his back very straight, and a slight hiss of sibilance in his Burton Hopkins, tones, he would say to Danielle Souness: &quot;It is a lie, agreed?&quot; or &quot;Pause there. Take your time. It is an important matter and you're on oath.&quot; His favoured phrases are &quot;plainly and simply&quot; and &quot;absolute light and clarity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He liked to cut off a witness with a crisp &quot;thank you&quot; when he had heard what he was seeking, leading Carman to lean across more than once during the cross examination of the first Mrs Souness and murmur: &quot;Let her finish&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case cast an interesting sidelight on what sums and understandings may be involved in the process known as &quot;selling your story to the newspapers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deals with the press are often viewed in modern myth as a kind of alternative version of the National Lottery, but the deals revealed in this trial suggested that the price of gossip has been exaggerated. The 1992 going rate for Graham Souness's front page Sun exclusive about his impending triple bypass heart surgery was, the court was told, Pounds 50,000. Danielle Souness said she took home Pounds 15,000 for the Sunday People story that was to persuade her former husband to sue for libel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the source of Graeme Souness's lame, this trial scarcely touched on football, although his first wile spoke briefly of the difficulty of living with a soccer manager when his team was losing.  It was about money and marriage and whether the insults hurled after the break up of a marriage could be classified as defamatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE door of the boys bedroom opened just a crack, and out peered the eyes of Jason Duignan. He listened for a minute to his father:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jesus, I can't go back to America! I love my kids. This is where I'm from. Ireland.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Henry (6) and Jason (5), their father is a hero. Earlier, under the watchful eye of their mother, they had taken a strange man with a spiral notepad by the hand to the garage at the side of their cottage in Drumsna. Inside was a perfectly restored and remodelled horse cab, the work of a master carpenter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Kay Duignan says her hopes are pinned on her husband, Leo, getting a job at Masonite. The couple spent five years in Brooklyn, making good money, but came home after Henry was born because New York City was no place to raise a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Duignan got a job building boats in Carrick on Shannon, and signed up for a car and a mortgage. But the company went under; he's now on a FAS scheme, awaiting a chance to show his stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only people who are against Masonite are rich people who have their houses paid for and their families reared,&quot; Mrs Duignan says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theirs is the majority view around Drumsna and Carrick. A local publican, Mr Liam Taylor, says Leitrim needs jobs desperately. He gestures, gently, towards a group of customers: &quot;These four are working on the by pass, just putting the finishing touches to it.  Then what?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a solid minority of people are not happy about the project.  Two doors up Drumsna's main street, in Duignan's pub (no relation to Leo's family), some are bitter and afraid. One man, whose name is known to The Irish Times but who asked not to be identified, says the issue is now turning neighbour against neighbour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not against jobs. I'm not even against this factory. I just don't like the way it was done,&quot; he says. &quot;There's no reason why tourism and industry can't exist together, with a fair bit of imagination. But how can a $ 15 billion company like that come in here with minimum standards? It's just not on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Mr Higgins, who demanded changes in the plan this week, had behaved honourably. &quot;Masonite wasn't prepared to take criticism on board when it was from Joe Public. It took a Minister to get them to compromise.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Carrick, the president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Liam Farrell, disagrees. He points to the many information meetings held by Masonite, where he says company executives answered all questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They met everyone from the ICA to the widows' association.  Masonite has in no way been covert in its dealings. Anyone who wants to get up off their butt can read the environmental impact study.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stresses that as a local auctioneer he has a vested interest in the region remaining unspoilt for tourism. As bona fides, he offers that the Chamber of Commerce was at the forefront of the campaign against large electricity pylons, and the proposed demolition of the Town Hall. But Masonite, he believes, will not damage the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only that, he says, but it is ideal for the county: &quot;It's a full circle; planting trees, the sawmill, then the value added product. All taking place here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closest house to the site belongs to Mrs Kay Reynolds. Behind the low, grey wall her garden is a riot of lupins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not a bit worried about the factory. It's the best thing that ever came around the place,&quot; she says. She is satisfied by the assurances not only of Masonite but also of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), that there will be no damage to the vicinity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She scoffs at the idea of noise pollution: &quot;This is the N4! There are lorries passing here 24 hours a day. I don't, see how this would be any worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her face breaks into a smile, though, when she contemplates the argument that the land facing her home should be reserved for farming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For six months of the year, that there is a swamp! We had photographers down here earlier because there were about 50 swans swimming in it. This is not agricultural land by any stretch of the imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the road, in a bungalow facing part of the site, the elderly owner is set against the factory. Asking not to be named, he says his objections are being handled by a solicitor in Longford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe in the EPA - I was very impressed with that man - but Masonite will have a 75 foot high chimney stack. How will the EPA monitor that without a helicopter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone who has visited a town in Mississippi where Masonite has another factory, he says, complained of &quot;a sickening smell of linseed oil&quot;, and the noise from the plant and the trucks would probably be unbearable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is low cloud in Leitrim for much of the year, he says, and he worries about the smoke from the factory being trapped. &quot;It'll be like the smog of London long ago - I was there for a while - the stuff won't be able to get up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expresses a deep distrust of American run multinational companies, and their motives: &quot;They felt they were dealing with a bunch of Paddys and they thought, we were a soft option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end of the day, he concedes, Masonite will probably win the right to open the factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up on the site, a Laois man in a Silvatec tree cut and stripper has been working 15 hour days to clear the site. &quot;Do you think it'll go through?&quot; he wants to know. He considers the company's proposed payroll of 350 men and women: &quot;Then there's the supply jobs, the trades. It'll be like the economy of this place has won the Lotto.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN North Down the Ulster Unionist Party asked the electorate if they wanted as their new MP a solid, hard-working candidate like Alan McFarland or a &quot;messiah&quot; like Robert McCartney who had pledged to light a fire that will sweep across Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early yesterday morning at the Newtownards count centre, those 38.75 per cent of the 70,000 electorate who bothered to vote chose the new political &quot;messiah&quot;, a politician who feels no incongruity at being compared to the trail-blazing Lord Edward Carson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now both unionists and nationalists are viewing the new MP with deep interest, some expectation and some trepidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McCartney, the fearsome QC who KO'd Barry McGuigan for Pounds 650,000 in his libel battle with the bookmaker Mr Barney Eastwood, will now strive to destroy the British-Irish Framework Documents, and as a possible consequence of that effort the Ulster Unionist Party leader, Mr James Molyneaux.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, in Newtownards yesterday morning Mr McCartney, the intellectual populist, immodestly repeated that his victory will change the political landscape of Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He describes himself as a &quot;catalyst&quot; who can bring the disparate strands of unionism together, although one suspects that, like Lord Carson, he sees himself more as a leader of a united unionism than a mere agent for a new unionism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can read too much into Mr McCartney's victory, but equally one can underestimate its impact, which is precisely what his opponents were trying to do yesterday. The Taoiseach, Mr Bruton, the UUP and the Alliance Party were taking sanctuary in the low turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument seemed to be that here was a victory for apathy. Sir Oliver Napier, the Alliance candidate who was close to pipping Mr McFarland for second place, was insistent that because of the poor poll the result could not be viewed as a referendum on the frameworks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UUP and Alliance also argued that by-elections should not be treated with too much seriousness; they were merely protests, warning messages, to the British and Irish governments, and also to the main Ulster Unionist Party establishment. And anyway hadn't North Down a penchant for throwing up mavericks who are irrelevant to real politics?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Molyneaux was so unperturbed by the result that he felt unable to cancel or postpone a series of engagements in England this week, in order to come home and fight his corner, and more importantly to try to rally his troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he issued a statement of astonishing pique, lending further ammunition to Mr McCartney's argument that Mr Molyneaux has lost his political direction. In criticising the voters of North Down for electing Mr McCartney the UUP leader complained that they had &quot;suffered least from terrorist savagery and can afford to forget people in the frontier counties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Down, while not to the same extent as other constituencies, has also suffered its share of murder, bomb damage and other miseries as a result of the troubles. There may have been an element of truth in Mr Molyneaux's statement, but its sheer insensitivity was truly incredible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unfortunate but courageous Mr Ken Maginnis was sent on television and radio to bat on Mr Molyneaux's behalf, inevitably it was a hopeless wicket. Mr Maginnis complained of Mr McCartney's arrogance, describing him as the &quot;I Am The Great I Am&quot;, but couldn't put up a credible defence for his leader's comments. And no, he said, there was no threat to Mr Molyneaux's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Mr McCartney had to do was dismiss Mr Molyneaux's remarks as &quot;misinformed nonsense&quot;, suggest that they were a further endorsement of his criticism of his handling of the Framework Documents, and then speak eloquently about creating a pluralist society, a new non-sectarian unionism offering civil and religious liberty for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony is that the beleaguered Mr Molyneaux has been close to the mark in suggesting prior to election day that a victory for Mr McCartney threatened to put back the peace process by 10 years. The problem is, he is no match for Mr McCartney in arguing his point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McCartney is an integrationist. He wants the Framework Documents smashed. Dublin can have no say. There must be no cross-Border bodies of any description. Even his gestures to nationalists are patronising: of course, the nationalist &quot;cultural and ethnic heritage&quot; must be recognised and allowed, but there will be no political link, however tenuous, with the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And all this credibly argued with panache and driving confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is too early to predict the extent of Mr McCartney's influence on future politics in Northern Ireland, neither should he be dismissed as a misguided maverick. The poor turnout may yet be a statement of general voter sympathy with current political developments, but equally, Mr McCartney is a new unpredictable phenomenon who could upset current peace developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His victory will imbue the DUP with new confidence, and vitalise those hardline elements in the UUP who decry Mr Molyneaux's softly-softly approach to current political movements. He is a man to watch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EUROPE must unite to fight against any relaxation of controls on drugs and attempt to reduce the demand for the &quot;Black death of the 90s&quot; through education and strong customs controls, an anti drugs conference in London was told yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference which Was organised by the European Cities Against Drugs (ECAD), discussed different methods to control drug abuse and welcomed five new cities, including Belfast, to the campaign by signing the resolution totally rejecting the legalisation of illicit drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lord Mayor of Belfast, Mr Eric Smyth, told the conference that the city had decided to join the campaign because there had been a &quot;dramatic&quot; rise in drug abuse following the cease fire. &quot;Northern Ireland is a place where family life is held very dear. It is very hard to go into homes that have been destroyed because of drugs and to see young people who have destroyed their lives by throwing themselves out of windows thinking that they can fly. We are new to all of this and don't know very much about it,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr Smyth said he supported the reduction of the security forces in the city, he stressed that it enabled drug traffickers to now operate freely. &quot;It is undeniable that dealers are now able to operate with much less chance of discovery than before even though police resources have been diverted away from terrorism to tackle the drugs problem.&quot; Mrs Grainne Kenny, the chair of European Cities Against Drugs (EURAD) read a letter of support to the conference from Mr Gay Mitchell, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, who suggested the creation of a European Coastguard to control drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European Union should use a mixture of the stick and the carrot to pursue this problem to source. Why not trade sanctions against, or economic aid to, those producing countries as an incentive to stop drug production?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Kenny described several incidents in Dublin of people being mugged by criminals threatening to stab them with a used needle. &quot;The Police Federation has asked for this type of crime to be classed as attempted murder. We should also be examining the rights of the non drug population,&quot; she argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Catherine Volz, the chief of the legal section of the UN Drug Control Programme, told the conference that during the last year drug trafficking in Europe had &quot;accelerated&quot; particularly in the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HALIFAX</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE presidents and prime ministers of the seven industrialised nations, seated round a dinner table behind the renaissance facade of Government House in Halifax, agreed yesterday evening that the setting up of a Rapid Reaction Force in Bosnia was a good thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were stunned when President Clinton announced casually that while he thought it a good idea, the US could not help finance it: the world's richest nation could not guarantee to pay its 31 per cent share of the estimated cost of $ 40 million over six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The humiliating admission by the US president that he had to defer to financial masters in Washington became the talking point of the Group of Seven (G7) summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clinton's Republican opponents, Senator Bob Dole and House Speaker, Mr Newt Gingrich, wrote to him to say they would not provide Congressional funds for the UN force, designed to extract the UNPROFOR peacekeepers from Bosnia if necessary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overnight the issue was resolved, for the moment, by the Security Council at UN headquarters in New York. Its members, including the US, agreed to approve the new force, on the basis that the UN General Assembly, not the Security Council, has responsibility for financial matters. The Bill will eventually go to Washington but with no guarantee that it will be paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference yesterday, Mr Clinton defended his decision not to send troops to Bosnia or take sides. How long had the conflict in Northern Ireland gone on - for 25 years - until they reached agreement to stop fighting, he asked, rhetorically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How long have they been fighting in the Middle East - for four decades before they made the progress they are making now? How deeply rooted are the conflicts between the Bosnians who are Serbo Croatians and the Muslims, at least going back to the 11th century?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise the G7 leaders had little new to say about Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the dinner, Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Jean Chretien, in a surprise late night appearance summed up the conclusions of the seven comprising the US, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when all the information indicates that there is a danger of renewed fighting in Bosnia, particularly in Sarajevo, we send out to all the parties a strong call for the greatest restraint,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appeal to the Bosnian Serbs and the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina to establish an immediate moratorium on military operations in order to allow political negotiations without which no lasting solution is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We call upon the Croatian government and the Krajina Serbs to refrain from all military action and to resume the negotiating process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In French Mr Chrotien used stronger language, saying they required the end of fighting. In reality the economic G7 could do little until it became the political G8 yesterday with the arrival of President Yeltsin of Russia for political discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chechen crisis, nuclear disarmament but above all the war in Bosnia headed the agenda for these talks. With Russia's influence over the Serbs, Mr Yeltsin is now recognised as a major player on the international scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan is not happy with Russia's new world role. Foreign Minister, Mr Yohei Kono, complained to the British Foreign Minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, that Russia was behaving like a super power in Asia even while it receives Japanese foreign aid, frequently shooting at Japanese fishing boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Asia, Russia deals with its neighbours in a different manner compared to Europe,&quot; Mr Kono said, according to Japanese officials.  &quot;Japan has given a lot of our taxpayers' money in financial aid to Russia. This is to help with their economic reforms, not to have it revert to a superpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British officials were equally blunt about the &quot;brutality of the Russians&quot; in Chechnya but the Chechens have no supporters in Halifax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By holding hostages in the southern Russian city of Budenavsk, the Chechen rebels have thwarted Russian boasts that the war is over but have made the Russian leader appear the victim of terrorism, rather than the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There can be no justification nor any support for such an act of terrorism,&quot; said a White House spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first formal participation at the summit, Mr Yeltsin is attending three working sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual G7 members took their own Bosnian initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France sent a stern warning to the warring parties yesterday, saying it would pull out its peacekeepers if the fighting went on.  The Foreign Minister, Mr Herve de Charette, told Canadian television that &quot;if nobody wants peace, some time we'll leave and we'll let them fight themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Mr Clinton's shock announcement about US funding at the dinner, he said there was a not very dignified problem about money when people were dying in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chancellor Helmut Kohl confronted the British Prime Minister, Mr Major, at the end of the G7's morning session yesterday over his approval of plans to sink a disused oil platform in the sea off Scotland, but found an unsympathetic ear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prime minister maintained our position very firmly,&quot; a senior British official told reporters. Mr Major told Dr Kohl that Britain had examined the issue very carefully and had concluded that deep sea burial was the best practicable environmental option for the Royal Dutch/Shell group's Brent Spar rig. He also said Britain was acting in accordance with its international commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G7 summiteers - Mr Chretien, Mr Major, Mr Clinton, Dr Kohl, French President Jacques Chirac, Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, and Italian Prime Minister, Mr Lamberto Dini produced their summit communique yesterday evening. It focussed on reform at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The security of Germany is defunded on its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS remark of Prince Otto von Bismarck was quoted with approval by Mr Hans Friedrich von Ploetz, secretary of the German federal Foreign Office, last week at a seminar for international journalists in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We met in the Rathaus, the city mayoralty's fine red brick headquarters. It was built in the 20 years after Germany's victory over France in 1871, when Berlin expanded enormously in population, size and political centrality as the capital of a united country under Bismarck's chancellorship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All around the Rathaus in east Berlin, a vast building programme is under way in preparation for the city's assumption once again of capital status in a united Germany. Although many experiences and issues still divide its eastern and western inhabitants, there is a palpable and attractive buzz about Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr von Ploetz argued that Germany has put its imperial past decisively behind it. The two world wars were untypical of Germany's history as was its involvement in the business of colonial adventurism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence the reference to Bismarck's strategic maxim and the determination to ensure that Germany's borders no longer coincide with NATO's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strategically speaking, the situation as a united country was never as favourable as now,&quot; according to Mr von Ploetz. Its neighbouring countries - &quot;except perhaps for Britain&quot; - are interested in co operating with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no anti German coalition on our borders, relations with the US are excellent and with Russia they are as good as circumstances allow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the fall of the Berlin Wall, unification and the end of the Cold War, Mr van Ploetz said, &quot;our strategic interest is to consolidate this unique situation in history&quot;. &quot;Our eastern neighbours see that the European Union presents a completely new, nonhegemonic model of integration completely acceptable to us. The vital interests of Germany correspond with the vital interests of its neighbours.&quot; Mr van Ploetz would not, therefore, agree with Bismarck's observation - made more in sorrow than in anger - that &quot;he who speaks of Europe is mistaken&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German agenda was spelled out in a confidential position paper reported in the Wall Street Journal Europe on May 9th by Frederick Kempe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for next year's EU intergovernmental conference, it spelt out a federalising programme on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, justice and interior affairs and institutional reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kempe quotes a senior German official, one of the architects of its EU policies, as follows: &quot;It's obvious that we have a special role at the conference and in Brussels. If we stay put, the British and the French will see that nothing gets done . . . The future in Europe is with us. Our old position in Europe has been reestablished - at the centre of everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;European integration is the best tool to promote German interests. For us, it's clear that we have to continue to integrate.  For France (after Mr Chirac's election) it is becoming less clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that the Germans have to temper their federalising instinct to suit what its large state partners are willing to take.  Mr Michael Maclay, a policy adviser to the British Foreign Secretary.  Mr Douglas Hurd assured the Berlin seminar that while Britain is seeking no opt out from the CFSP, it will oppose majority voting within it. He outlined a programme of incremental change which would rely less on institutional arrangements than on a case by case identification of co operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jacques Chirac's dramatic affirmation of French national interest this week when he announced the resumption of French nuclear testing illustrates what is at stake in European security cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Berlin, Dr Helmut Kohl's chief foreign policy adviser, Mr Joachim Bitterlich, said he was much more in agreement with Mr Maclay than might be expected. It was noteworthy this week that the sharpest edge of German thinking on majority voting in EU foreign policy did not appear in proposals from the ruling CDU/ CSU coalition. But there is still a very considerable gulf separating the German and British approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A credible political union is necessary to persuade the German electorate to go into an economic and monetary union. Mr Bitterlich spoke of Europe at a crossroads and in a transition which will last a generation at least, especially in its eastern dimensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Mr van Ploetz were actively aware that European relations with the US and Russia are crucial. The tone and seriousness of their remarks brought home the extent to which Germany is responding to its new role of leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men are convinced that transatlantic relations need to be put on a new footing after the end of the Cold War. Whereas the military industrial complex in the US previously provided the essential glue to hold it together, the military security agenda is insufficient now. They think political and economic relations are more important principles. The German foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, has floated the idea of a transatlantic free trade area as a new integrating principle; it is being actively discussed between the EU and the US at meetings in Washington this week and at the G7 summit in Halifax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The balance of opinion so far is that it may be too ambitious and would be opposed by many EU states and interests - not least those who do best out of the common agricultural policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men are passionately convinced that Russia must be included in the new European security architecture and that this is fundamental to Germany's own long term interests. Again, political and economic principles are seen as more important than military and security ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, any mechanical or too rapid enlargement of NATO against Russian objections would only draw new lines of division in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, as Mr van Ploetz put it, a &quot;contradictory&quot; process as Russia seeks out its internal and external definitions. Mr Bitterlich said there is no need to make &quot;extreme demands on such a country, which fears being encircled&quot;. These questions cannot be resolved &quot;by bureaucratic models on a writing desk which do not respect the feelings of others&quot; or in the middle of election campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamental question at whether Russia itself could be included in NATO may not be answered for 25 years, he said. But it could be the best guarantee that Germany can defend its own borders and reduce the burden at geopolitical boundaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIRUT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOLIDERE is a name that might conjure up an image of trades unionism, but not in Beirut. Solidere is Lebanon's biggest business, the brainchild of the country's millionaire prime minister, and some say saviour, who also heads the company, Mr Rafiq Harriri. Its main job is to finish off what Lebanon's warring armies started, the levelling of the centre of Beirut. Then it will rebuild it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beirut's old city centre, the Square of the Martyrs, was the epicentre of the violence. Today it is a flat wasteland interrupted only over 1.8 sq km by mounds of earth, testimony to the frantic work of bulldozers and a few battered buildings that were given a reprieve.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reconstruction has unearthed a number of major archaeological sites such as an Ottoman Temple on top of a large Roman house, a few yards from an important Phoenician site, and there are promises that these will be preserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a country that takes pride in its entrepreneurial tradition and Mr Harriri, who has ploughed many millions of his own money into the great reconstruction project, seems genuinely to have found a way to tap into the billions his fellow countrymen have salted away abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year $ 6.5 billion was returned, attracted in part by the strong take up in $ 60 million Solidere flotation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's economy is booming, with 9 per cent growth forecast this year, and there are plenty of opportunities for Irish business, &quot;but you have to come and take them&quot;, says Mr John O'Neill, the manager of an ESB international project in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has been entrusted with the supervision of contracts to rebuild the devastated electricity system and to help the state power company's management structures, denuded, like many businesses, by war and exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its work, funded by the EU, is worth some Pounds 4 million to the company. Its 12 Irish staff operate from the third floor of the Electricite de Liban tower block overlooking the port - actually it is the fourth floor but the second is only a gaping hole so they have stopped counting it. When you are climbing broken stairs in 40 degrees Centigrade, you notice these things. Their challenge is formidable the country's power stations can only produce enough for eight to 10 hours a day, and the target to the end of the decade is 18 to 20 hours, requiring a total investment of some $ 2 billion in the power sectar alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr O'Neill and Mr Conor Lonergan, who have been here since the project started in December 1993, speak of the friendliness of the people and being surprised by the real absence of fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Harriri has his critics. Many of the expropriated property owners feel sore that they still have not received their promised shares in Solidere. Others, like Ireland's affable and efficient honorary consul, Mr Khaled Daouk, while supporting the general idea, are worried that perhaps too much has been knocked dawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet others warn of the signs that the national debris beginning to spiral out at control. These are not purely private works, the infrastructure power, water, sewerage etc. has to be paid for by the state. Lebanon's debt is expected to rise from 45 per cent to 90 per cent of GDP in the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as worrying is the failure to develop a manufacturing or trading base beyond the construction sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The artificiality of the economy is reflected in its ability to absorb over 1 1/2 million Syrian casual workers, a workforce some 50 per cent larger than Lebanon's own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extremes of wealth and poverty co exist in grotesque proximity. In the village of Shaqra in south Lebanon, visited on Thursday by the Tanaiste, Mr Spring, a new $ 4 million development is tinder construction, while Irish troops raise funds to help the destitute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along Beirut's once elegant corniche, $ 1 million flats are common with some even reported to have invested in lifts to bring their cars up several flights to their front door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And beyond the city centre, few imagine they will be moving soon out of their miserable war scarred tower blocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Mr Spring's tour of the Middle East continued with a tour of Damascus where last night he met members of the small Irish community. He meets the Syrian president, Mr Hafez Al Assad, today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, after a frenetic few days of activity, he relaxed at Beirut's famous golf club. He was partnered by the deputy Government spokesman, Mr John Foley, and the Irish Ambassador to Egypt, Mr Hugh Swift.</SPAN></P>

KATHRYN HONE visits Dreux, one of the towns most likely to fall under the party's control</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN the pedestrianised main street of Dreux, in the shadow of its fine medieval belfry, groups of youths of Arab origin stand about, talking and laughing together, while elderly French people, lips pursed, walk past, averting their eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few of the older people want to stop and talk about last weekend's poll-topping score for the National Front in the local elections in their town. But one retired woman finally does consent to talk, speaking in low tones so as not to be overheard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are just too many of them,&quot; Mrs Jacqueline Carroux confided. &quot;We're absolutely invaded.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Them&quot;, for most of the 35 per cent of Dreux voters who opted for the National Front last Sunday, is an amalgamation of all the foreign-looking inhabitants of their town, whether they are illegal immigrants, legal, established foreigners or French youngsters whose parents came to the town in the hoomtime 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the tiny, backstreet National Front HQ, they talk about immigrants and &quot;neo-French.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dreux: a French town,&quot; proclaim the National Front's election posters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to do exactly what they've done in California,&quot; explained the party's candidate, Mrs Marie-France Stirbois, smiling blond looks belying her harsh words. If she becomes the next mayor of Dreux after tomorrow's final round, Mrs Stirbois says, she will make sure that illegal immigrants no longer receive hospital treatment or schooling for their children in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will give instructions that illegals be pointed out to the authorities,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She would set up a special immigration unit in the town hall, she promised, which would &quot;inform&quot; the people of Dreux how much illegal immigrants are costing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a town that has operated at two speeds: the TGV (high-speed train) for foreigners and the omnibus for French people.&quot; She was referring to the previous right-wing RPR mayor's policy of trying to solve the problem of a turbulent public housing project by spending millions improving its facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you give less social benefits to immigrants and give priority in public housing to French people then fewer foreigners will come to Dreux,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to push this government to understand that they must control immigration so that things really change in France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dreux, 80 km west of Paris, has a high level of inhabitants of foreign origin, about a third of its population of 35,227 people. It is an isolated industrial town in a largely agricultural region. The main employers are the Phillips plant, manufacturing televisions, and a Renault factory. In a town depending on unskilled labour, recession has hit hard, and the unemployment rate of 20 per cent rises to over 50 per cent in neighbourhoods with a high level of immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This mixture has inevitably brought a high level of petty crime.  The National Front has promised extra municipal policing and video surveillance in the town centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of secondary-school teenaged boys of North African origin complained that all immigrants were blamed for the criminal activities of a small group of people in the town. &quot;If the Front gets in, we will no longer feel secure,&quot; Mohamed Fiach said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The left, which controlled Dreux for most of this century, will now disappear completely from the local council. As a result of the National Front's score, the team of united Socialists, Communists and Radicals, who came third (18 per cent) last Sunday made the painful decision to drop out of tomorrow's race in the hope that the RPR candidate, who came second to the National Front with 28 per cent, might just beat Mrs Stirbois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't take the National Front seriously enough when they first arrived here,&quot; the Socialist leader, Mr Maurice Ravanne, said regretfully. &quot;If they win on Sunday night, we fear there could be serious incidents in the town. But in the long term, the young people in the housing projects will only become discouraged and demoralised and therefore aggressive. There will be more incidents and clashes with the police than now. And no new businesses will want to move into Dreux.&quot;</SPAN></P>

What are we talking about? Answer: the Post Office at the corner of Sackville street and Princess street. So it says among a mass of close type in a scribbling diary for 1886, facsimiles of which have been kindly sent in by Mr Ken Mills of Fenian Street. There must be a couple of thousand words in' the closely packed but well ordered columns of information on all aspects of posting and receiving post. Stamps from a value of one half penny to five shillings can be purchased, but the text counsels the use of Stamped Envelopes (&quot;the use of which is recommended, as the Stamps cannot become detached&quot;). You could also buy stamped newspaper wrappings, bearing a half penny stamp, eight in all, for 43/4 pence a packet. Postcards could be bought in two kinds: six for 4 pence in the stout version and six for 3 1/2 pence in the thin version. (For convenience, what was printed on the original as d remember Pounds . s. d.? - is here rendered as pence. Something different.) (P)But the hours of delivery, again in Dublin, are incredible. The first delivery was at 7 a.m. including &quot;letters brought in by Irish Provincial night mails; letters posted at suburban boxes up to 9 p.m. the previous night, the Town District boxes at 4 a.m., and those posted at the Chief Office up to 6.45 a.m. Then there followed the second, third, fourth fifth and sixth delivery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one delivery on Sunday. You could read, and feel it in your heart for the hours that the post office officials put in. But it must certainly have given much employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today it's all going something called e mail and whatnot. Old style post is vanishing. But we do have our modern Fastpost. Recently a letter was sent from Dublin to the south of France by this method.  It arrived 10 days later. Goods ordered in the letter were posted back to Dublin by economy post. Came in six days. Everyone has his or her story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There seems little likelihood that the strike threatened at Dunnes Stores from Monday can now be averted. There was hope yesterday that the Labour Court would intervene but Dunnes management, by maintaining communications with the Labour Relations Commission, has kept the Labour Court out of the dispute. Rightly or wrongly, Dunnes management conveys the impression that it would prefer the strike to go ahead in the hope that it proves ineffective, rather than try to avert it by engaging in talks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it does go ahead and is prolonged, it could pose serious financial problems for Mandate, the shopworkers' trade union. About one sixth of its members are employed by Dunnes. If the strike succeeds in closing down the stores, it would manifest grave problems for Irish suppliers to Dunnes; many of them have virtually no other customer. A closure of the stores would, of course, greatly harm Dunnes itself. Consequently, if the strike proves effective no one will be surprised if Dunnes quickly agrees to meaningful talks even if they are with Mandate which it has tried to exclude from the dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move by Dunnes into Sunday opening is a byproduct of the intense competition which exists among supermarkets. Ever since they came into existence here, the rivalry between them has been keen. H.  Williams and Liptons went under, Five Star sold out, Tesco pulled out, giants like Sainsbury and Asda decided not to enter at all. In the last decade competition, particularly between Dunnes and the Quinnsworth/Crazy Prices group, has become exceptional - fuelled by the fact that overall spending in supermarkets is not rising significantly. Each must pitch aggressively for the other's customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market share figures are always contested but recent research suggests that Dunnes might have fallen behind their rivals, holding some four per cent less of the grocery trade. Opening on Sundays is one way of winning customers back, but the benefit may only be short term; if Dunnes firmly establishes Sunday opening, its competitors will be forced to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish Productivity Centre says that Sunday opening by supermarkets will not increase sales or generate many extra jobs. Its effect will be to spread the existing spend onto a seventh day. Of more consequence, RGDATA, the association of smaller, independent shops, reckons that as many 500 of its members could go out of business if all the supermarket chains go for seven day opening. For the public good, the advantages may be balanced by the disadvantages, but Sunday opening is already established. What is happening now is that it is being extended to supermarkets and out of town shopping centres. The omens are favourable. In the US and Britain it is phenomenally popular; an established way of life. More than ever before, shopping is regarded as a leisure time pursuit and people welcome its availability on Sundays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employees in Dunnes are not on strong ground in seeking a premium, especially given the comparatively generous wage level they now enjoy. But the notion that employees must make themselves available without any guarantee of work, is patently unfair. They are also entitled to expect that their union's right to negotiate on their behalf is respected. Sunday opening by supermarkets is inevitable. It does not have to be confrontational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN its first move into the Scandinavian market, the Jefferson Smurfit Group has paid Pounds 68 million to acquire a 29 per cent stake in the Swedish packaging company Munksjo AB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group chairman, Dr Michael Smurfit, described the move as a significant step in our strategy for our European operations&quot;.  Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian companies have traditionally traded aggressively in the Irish market and in every market that Smurfit trades in, he explained. But Smurfit has never been in their market before, he said. The acquisition brings Smurfit into a new product area - market pulp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Munksjo has a subsidiary in Poland. Swedish and Scandinavian companies consider Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia as their natural markets, Dr Smurfit explained. But he added: &quot;Whether we develop with them in these markets will have to be considered&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smurfit paid 64 Swedish krona per share, a premium 3 to 4 krona per share, to acquire its stake in the publicly quoted company from mining and rubber company, Trelleborg. Dr Smurfit began discussions late yesterday with Munksjo directors on board representation for his group. Taking a significant minority stake is the traditional way we operate in new markets&quot;, Dr Smurfit said. &quot;We will get to know the market, the people and the culture and the then decide where to go from there&quot;. But he added the group has no arrangements &quot;to take our stake further&quot; at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An industrial holding group, Munksjo produces corrugated and other packaging, speciality papers, hygiene products, bleached pulp and envelopes. The company reported a turnover of 3,289 million krona (Pounds 279 million) for 1994 and profits after tax of 276 million krona.  It employs 2,800 people, mainly in Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smurfit has acquired its stake on a historic price earnings ratio of 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on consensus market earnings forecasts, NCB analyst Mr John Conroy said the PE will fall to 6 to 6 1/2 in 1995/96 due to earnings growth at Munksjo. Because Smurfit is paying cash for its stake, he calculated that the acquisition will be earnings enhancing for the group. It will add 1/2p plus to earnings per share, he forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Munksjo annual production includes 150,000 tonnes of market pulp, 50,000 tonnes of tissue and 65,000 tonnes of speciality paper.  Smurfit's Cellulose operation in France is a large purchaser of market pulp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Trelleborg spokesman, Mr Lief Oberg, said his group decided to sell its Munksjo stake because &quot;paper and pulp is not our strategic business&quot;. Trelleborg made a capital gain of just over 100 million krona (about Pounds 8.5 million) on the transaction, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JEFFERSON Smurfit Group shares closed at 168p yesterday, failing to gain in a rising market after a 3 1/2p fall on Thursday. A weakening US paper market has been blamed for the recent slide in the group share price. Group shares were not helped by the downgrading of five US paper stocks, competitors of Smurfit's US associate JS Corporation, from buy to neutral yesterday by Morgan Stanley.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At yesterday's 168p close, group shares were at a 1995 low and well off their 1995 high of 207.5p and the all time high of 221p achieved after the Cellulose du Pin acquisition was announced in May 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US market paper stocks fell this week after official figures showed a surprise fall of 2.7 per cent fall in corrugated box shipments for May against an expected rise of around 2 per cent. The latest figures are another sign of a slowdown in paper shipments since a series of price increases across the industry which brought linerboard prices from $ 290 per tonne two years ago to about $ 525 per tonne now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paper stocks in the US had risen strongly on the back of rising product prices sustained by supply shortages. But Jefferson Smurfit Corporation, the publicly quoted US associate of the Jefferson Smurfit group, has underperformed the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Floated at $ 13.50, the JS Corp shares jumped to just over $ 20 before falling sharply in recent weeks. JS Corp shares traded down $ 1/8 yesterday to close below the flotation price at $ 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry inventory levels have now risen from 4.1 to 4.8 weeks.  But some analysts argue that developments so far are not sufficient to unravel earlier price rises. The market is now in balance and is not the strong sellers market of some months ago, they maintain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in nervous markets as the US economy slows, analysts see little upside potential for JS Corp shares in the short term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DICKENS's Mr Micawber is perhaps the proponent for the dictum of income exceeding expenditure and the misery that awaits the profligate should the harmonious balance be exceeded by even one penny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Kilduff, executive chairman of hard pressed computer group Reflex was concerned with more than a few stray pennies this week when he revealed group pre tax losses of Pounds 5.8 million last year and a collapse in shareholders funds from Pounds 1.8 million to a paltry Pounds 154,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under company law such a wafer thin gap between assets and liabilities requires the convening of an extraordinary general meeting to consider the future of the business. Mr Kilduff, with a Micawber like rationale rare among public company chairman, described the situation as &quot;disgraceful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has now slimmed down with the sale of loss making assets, including its main Irish software company, Auto Computing, which was jettisoned at a loss of Pounds 1.8 million, and service company Reflex Maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflex has shrunk to three companies in Britain and a small head office in Dublin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While lacking great expectations, management nevertheless confidently expects &quot;something good to turn up&quot;. Kilduff stresses that, having backed away at the dead wood, the group's two remaining computer rental and one software companies are now trading profitably. But with a perilous financial position, a loss per share of 22.56p and a share price in single figures the immediate outlook is positively Dickensian.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADARE Printing has reported strong growth in the 12 month period to the end of April, posting a 122 per cent rise in profits before tax to Pounds 3.28 million compared with Pounds 1.47 million in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Largely boosted by recent acquisitions in Britain, Adare has reported a 57 per cent increase in sales from Pounds 28.4 million in 1993 to Pounds 43.8 million last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three companies which it bought last year, Great Northern Envelope Company, Alexander Pettigrew and Label Converters, accounted for Pounds 10.5 million of total sales, its full year results have shown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These three acquisitions generated Pounds 0.9 million of Adare's operating profits, which are up by 110 per cent to Pounds 3.4 million from Pounds 1.6 million in the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing its results yesterday, the company said it will have to consider acquiring the printing divisions of other large companies to meet its targets for growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It stressed that while not all of these acquisitions would be immediately earnings enhancing, such a move could bring the group into new areas of rapidly growing markets, such as the production of CD booklets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement added that Adare was now generating substantial cash flow which will be used to its capital expenditure plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since April, Adare has paid Pounds 12 million for the Dublin based Mount Salus Press, which specialises in publishing computer manuals and printing school books. Next year, the company expects that the enlarged group will generate sales of around Pounds 70 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adare has announced a 25 per cent increase in its final year dividend to shareholders, to 1.30p compared with 1.04p last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earnings per share rose by 72 per cent to 28.43p from 61.5p in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board said that it intended to bring its dividend closer to the average dividend paid by other second line industrial companies in the Republic, at the final dividend stage next year, &quot;when, in the absence of further acquisitions, the group's indebtedness will have been paid down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 12 months, Adare has seen significant increases in its raw materials costs due to the sharp rise in paper prices, with some grades rising by 65 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through cost reductions, the group said, it has since recovered a proportion of its profit margins.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE leaders of the top seven industrial nations gave the global economy a clean bill of health yesterday. At the same time they wrote a prescription to cope with emergencies such as that caused by the collapse of the sickly Mexican peso, which last December threatened to affect other countries throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called for greater glasnost in the reporting of the world's financial institutions so that early measures could be taken to prevent the sudden collapse of a single country's economy sending shock waves through global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Group of Seven (G7) leaders also called for an unemployment conference attended by world employment and foreign ministers to tackle the problem of continuing high rates of unemployment in industrialised countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most important G7 initiative was the recommendation to create a $ 56 billion (Pounds 38 billion) fund to bail out countries in emergencies and prevent a tailspin in world currencies like that which almost followed the collapse of the Mexican peso in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressing need for the buttressing of market stability underlay the upbeat tone of the communique issued on the second day of the summit of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and Canada in the Canadian port of Halifax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communique said: &quot;We remain encouraged by the continued strong growth in much of the world's economy. While there has been some slowing in most of our countries, the conditions for continued growth appear to be in place and inflation is well under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G7 leaders, who announced that their next summit would be held in Lyon, France a year from now, also called for rich nations to cooperate closely in the increasingly volatile currency markets, but stopped short of any agreement to curb currency speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such speculations was condemned by the French president, Mr Jacques Chirac, as &quot;the AIDS of our economies.&quot; He promised to press for measures against speculators at next year's summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite concern in Japan and Europe over the weakness of the US dollar, the communique contained no agreement on bold new measures to strengthen the American currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prevent crisis in world economies the G7 leaders urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to establish benchmarks for the timely publication of key economic and financial date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the IMF should also establish a procedure for the regular public identification of countries which comply with these benchmarks. It should insist on fall and timely reporting by member countries of standard sets of data, provide sharper policy advice to all governments, and deliver franker messages to countries that appear to be avoiding necessary actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are doing is trying to respond to situations such as Mexico. This is not a blank cheque to anybody,&quot; a senior Canadian said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communique also urged the IMF to establish an &quot;emergency financing mechanism&quot; to provide more money faster in crisis situations. The planned extra money would come by doubling the &quot;General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB)&quot; - a $ 28 billion credit line available to the IMF for use in emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial institutions were shaken by the Mexico crisis, the collapse of the British Barings Bank and the bankruptcy of Orange County, California. The IMF was criticised for failing to warn the world about Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit leaders completed their economic discussions to clear the way for talks last night and today with the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bill Clinton put together a rescue package for Mexico of $ 20 billion after foreign investors withdrew their money from the country, creating panic across Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit leaders promised to work together to lower tariffs and to ensure a &quot;well functioning and respected dispute settlement mechanism&quot; to resolve differences on trade.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE European Commission has objected to the terms the Government is offering to bidders for the second mobile phone licence, and new proposals must now be agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the deadline for bids for the licence has been extended from next Friday, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Mr Lowry, has announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission is concerned that the new operator will compete at a disadvantage to Eircell, the existing mobile phone company run by Telecom Eireann. The Government had proposed that the new operator would pay a large up front fee to the exchequer and an annual licence, costs not faced by Eircell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lowry announced last night that his officials would pursue the issue urgently with the EU Commission. No new deadline for bids has been set, but the Minister said he hoped the discussions would be completed in four weeks. He said he remained confident that the winner will be selected this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government is now likely to have to change the terms under which the licence is issued. It may have to substantially reduce the up front fee charged to the new operator - which was likely to have been around Pounds 15 million to Pounds 20 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One approach would be to set a maximum level for the fee at a substantially lower figure, leaving the licence to be decided on the basis of the quality of service the new operator would offer. Mr Lowry has said consistently that the licence will be awarded on the basis of which consortium would offer the best service, not which would pay the highest price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU may also suggest that Eircell be faced with paying a charge similar to the new operator - or, perhaps more likely, be subjected to a similar annual licence fee - to ensure fair competition. Last night Telecom Eireann had no comment to make on the announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the existing Government plan the annual charge to the second operator was likely to have been in the region of Pounds 750,000, meaning the up front charge was the main cost. Sources in the telecommunications industry said last night the Commission had been examining the issue for some time and had also looked at a mobile licence auction in Belgium. It is now likely to try to come up with a common approach across Europe for the way new entrants and existing companies should be treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in most EU states second, and sometimes third, licences have already been issued with no charge levied on the existing operator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three consortiums have officially declared their interest in the licence. These include Irish Cellular Telephones, including US giant AT&amp;T, Independent Newspapers subsidiary Princes Holdings, US cable operator, Telecommunications Incorporated and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Personna consortium includes Motorola, the Unisource consortium of EU telecommunication companies, the ESB, and Dublin company Sigma Wireless. A third group includes US communications company Comcast, RTE and Bord na Mona.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Irish market had a solid, if not spectacular, week and, with bond markets continuing to remain stable, the outlook is for further gains, if international markets can build on their recent gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the leading stocks are benefiting from strong demand, as are the better second liners, although a drift in the Smurfit share price is limiting the gain of the overall ISEQ index. Trading volumes during the week were steady.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While international bonds had a serious wobble at the end of last week, growing evidence of slowing growth in the US in particular led to a firmer tone this week and Dublin gilt prices continued to edge upwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, financial stocks are gaining strongly from the recovery in bond markets. Both Bank of Ireland and AIB put on a few pence during the week, with AIB now nudging the 300p barrier and Bank of Ireland's next hurdle the 350p mark. Irish Life is holding around 208p-210p having struggled to breach the 200p level for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the industrial stocks CRH is now well underpinned around 400p, ending the week with further gains yesterday to bring it to 403p, having risen 10p during the week. Greencore is also strongly in demand, setting new highs and ending the week 3p ahead at 450p. Other stocks attracting interest are Independent Newspapers, Kerry and Irish Continental, with many other second liners also showing gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid all the gains, Smurfit, which represents 15 per cent of the market, continues to languish. Against the trend, it ended the week down 6p at 168p, affected by the continued &quot;bad vibes&quot; surrounding the sector in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US paper shipments for May showed a surprise fall of 2.7 per cent and possible downgradings of Stone Corporation and International Paper - two of the big US paper companies - could continue to depress the Smurfit price. Elsewhere, the difficult financial situation at Reflex was underlined by annual figures showing shareholders' funds of Pounds 154,000 at the end of last year. Meanwhile, IWP reported an 11 per cent rise in pretax profits to Pounds 16.6 million and says it is on the look out for further acquisitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the market in general, if international markets remain firm, then there is no reason why Irish stocks should not continue to gain ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts point out that the Irish market is trading on a 1995 price/ earnings ratio of around 9.7, well below the 13 to 14 times earnings which UK stocks are commanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are few economic figures out to influence either Irish or international markets next week, so the emerging theory of a slowdown in the US - and to a lesser extent UK - economy is likely to continue to dominate. This should underpin the current comfortable tone in the Dublin money and gilt markets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT has been described as &quot;Dances with Pars,&quot; which seems delightfully appropriate given that film actor/director Kevin Costner has been seen of late hanging around Shinnecock Hills pressing the flesh with real live golfers. Apparently Costner, who almost holed a 50 foot chip for a par at Shinnecock's ninth last Sunday, is attempting to pick up some pointers for a film he is planning about the Royal and Ancient game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the play on the title of Costner's celebrated movie &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; has to do with another subject entirely the experience of the American Indian in the hugely lucrative world of golf course development. In this context, it is clear that the Shinnecock Indians got a raw deal, while the Seminole and Kiawah tribes have nothing to show from courses which bear their names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, however, have done remarkably well. With a cumulative land area larger than the state of Idaho, a sparse population and no city, county or state red tape to worry about, the 550 Indian reservations in the US have the freedom to decide their own destiny - for a price.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly resourceful are the Paiute tribe. With the help of the Landmark development company, they have commissioned the celebrated US architect, Pete Dye, to build a 72 hole complex on 3,800 acres of reservation land just outside Las Vegas. When completed next year, the total price tag, including two highway interchanges and a casino hotel, is $ 182 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that the Paiutes have taken to Dye as one of their own, because of his crusty disposition. According to Thomas Climo, the tribe's economic development director, Landmark, their business associates, are &quot;an entirely different beast.&quot; But he added: &quot;They have come along way towards understanding Native American sensitivities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their brothers in the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Connecticut have also done well out of a $ 142 million development involving two courses built by Robert Trent Jones and his son, Rees. Sadly, however, the boon to the tribes is largely about money: golf has made no impact on their hearts and minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got 20 Native Americans who play out here regularly but it's not a sport that people take up automatically,&quot; said Daniel Nunez, professional at the Inn of the Mountain Gods resort in New Mexico, where Mescalero Reservation natives receive an 87 per cent discount on the $ 60 green fee. &quot;We're slowly starting to get the kids involved, but only little by little.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, when it comes to dances with pars, the native Americans are reluctant participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Costner is collaborating on the golf project with director Ron Shelton, the man behind his baseball movie, &quot;Bull Durham.&quot; The plot has Costner as a golf professional who falls for one of the top player's girlfriend. &quot;I'm not telling who wins,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what you pay the seven bucks for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Old golfing rivalries achieved a new dimension, in New York this week by entering the world of the public auction. It happened when 15 rather special items came under the Christie's hammer at the so called Auction of the Century, held to mark the Centennial of the US Golf Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the nature of the items was somewhat different, there was no mistaking the greater appeal of Jack Nicklaus over long time rival Arnold Palmer, as far as bidders were concerned. Americans may love Arnie as a man, but where golfing skills are concerned, they clearly recognise that time takes its toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was that the top bid at the auction was $ 78,000 for a round of golf with Nicklaus plus an all expenses paid, week long tour of some of his finest courses, for up to eight people. The trip will start at the Los Cabos and Palmilla courses in Mexico and finish at the exclusive Loxahatchee club in Palm Beach, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, &quot;A Day With The King&quot; went for $ 38,000 - less than half the Nicklaus figure. This offered four golfers the prospect of lunch and a round of golf with Palmer at his Bay Hill Club in Orlando, Florida. After golf, there was the bonus of a tour of the studios of The Golf Channel, highlighted by an on air appearance for broadcast the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another valuable lot offered a day as Greg Norman's partner in the pro am for the Holden Classic in Sydney next November, followed by an 11 day oriental cruise for two. It went for $ 27 000 The auction raised more than $ 400,000 for various charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Members and officials of Shinnecock Hills have cleared out for the week. In an arrangement unique to the club, they have leased their course for an estimated fee of close on $ 1 million to the US Golf Association, who are currently in the process of using the arrangement to generate serious money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, the centennial US Open, is expected to earn in excess of $ 35 million which is somewhat ironic, given that Shinnecock and Pebble Beach, the two venues most cherished by the organisers, are the least profitable. It means that the USGA should, easily surpass, the $ 7 million profit which it achieved in 1993, its most lucrative year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is anticipated that when all of the dollars and cents have been counted, the net figure from this week will be more than $ 15 million, which is hardly surprising when one considers that the cost of a corporate tent here is $ 125,000. And there was no shortage of customers, corporate or private. In fact attendances of 25,000 per day are up by 50 per cent on 1986 and the club expect to serve 1,200 meals per day, this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rough breakdown of US Open cash is: Television - $ 13 million from a three year $ 40 million deal with NBC plus $ 6 million for the foreign and cable rights (ESPN); merchandising - $ 5 million; tickets $ 4.5 million; corporate hospitality - $ 3.75; food and drink $ 1.3 million; entry fees - $ 600,000; programme advertising - $ 350,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrangement with Shinnecock was conceived by the then USGA executive director Frank Hannigan for the 1986 US Open. In effect, he was following the lead of the Royal and Ancient who are responsible for the running of the British Open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Last weekend, 50 years ago, Byron Nelson completed the sixth leg of an historic 11 successive tournament victories. It came in the Montreal Open at the Islemere G and CC on June 7th-10th when he shot four rounds in the sixties for an aggregate of 268 and a victory by 10 strokes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It's nice to know that tournament golfers can appreciate a touch of romantic humour. Tom Lehman clearly considered it to be appropriate when he was confronted by a fairway experience with big hitting John Daly during practice for this week's US Open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Lehman and his partners were walking towards the ninth green after hitting their second shots - they were roughly 325 yards from the tee at the time a lone golf ball gently trundled past them. Well aware of who had hit it, Lehman picked up the ball, wrote something on it and placed it on a tee in the fairway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Daly reached the ball, he saw that it had been inscribed with the name of supermodel Elle MacPherson and a drawing of a heart. &quot;To show him that we appreciated the beauty of his shot,&quot; explained Lehman later. The sentiment wasn't wasted on Big John insofar as he put the ball in his pocket and hit another one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. No doubt you have been blissfully unaware of this, so we feel obliged to inform you that the wrong underwear could be undermining your golf game. Naturally, in their relentless search for perfection, our American cousins have come up with the solution - courtesy of a woman designer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These briefs, we are assured, go beyond boxers or Jockeys. The e2u (&quot;ergonomically engineered underwear&quot;) is a user friendly hybrid of an athletic supporter and a standard brief. According to chief designer Cindy Michels, it is &quot;wedgie proof,&quot; whatever that means.  &quot;One tester said that it took three strokes off his game,&quot; she said.  Hmmni. They're called Skivvies and they're $ 19.95 a pair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GREG NORMAN projected such an air of patient calm during a sparkling second round of 67 at Shinnecock Hills yesterday that it may be necessary to revise his aggressive predatory image. While overnight leader Nick Price suffered in the wind and sun, the Great White Shark, on five under par, surged two strokes clear of the field at the halfway stage of the Centennial US Open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European challenge also regained momentum when Nick Faldo staged a typically courageous charge for a round of 68 to move back into contention in joint seventh place on 140, where he was joined by the splendid Mark Roe, who shot 69. And Bernhard Langer did even better. Putting beautifully on treacherously fast greens, he matched Norman with a 67 for a total of 141 five strokes inside the cut off limit of 146 - six over par.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Australian's standpoint, the mood may have been different but the position was distinctly familiar. When the event was last staged here in 1986, Norman's 139 made him the halfway leader by three strokes from Lee Trevino and Den is Watson. On this occasion his unlikely, closest challenger is the 48 year old Japanese, Masashi &quot;Jumbo&quot; Ozaki. Which means, no doubt, that Shinnecock is set to become the most photographed course in US Open history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making his ninth appearance in the championship, Ozaki has a best performance of tied sixth behind Curtis Strange at Oak Hill in 1989.  His prominence after a round of 68 also marks the most encouraging showing by a Japanese player since Isao Aoki was runner up to Jack Nicklaus at Baltusro in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, however, the severity of the challenge made it a humbling exercise for an elite field. Indeed, it, posed serious problems even for golfing legends. With a crushing 81, Nicklaus equalled his worst round in 39 appearances in the championship. &quot;I played terribly - I'm a little tired of working on my game right now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, for fear anyone might get the impression he was throwing in the towel, the great man - quickly added: &quot;I thought I had something, but hoping to get it in into my game a day before the Open simply didn't work. But it will work. I will play better as the year goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of Nicklaus's shots came on the infamous back nine which Jose Maria Olazabal handled in exemplary fashion for a second successive day. After returning a best of the championship homeward 32 - three under par - in his first round, the Spaniard went on to negotiate it with nine straight pars in a second round of 70 for a halfway total of 143.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are eight European survivors: Faldo and Roe (140), Langer (141), Ian Woosnam and Olazabal (143), Miguel Angel Jiminez (144), Colin Montgomerie on 145 and Barry Lane on the limit of 146.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typical of the havoc wreaked by a forbidding stretch was the experience of David Gilford who, after a brilliant front nine of 32, crashed to a horrendous nine at the par four 12th on the way to a 76 and 150. Seve Ballesteros also failed on 147, as did the Swedish pair Olle Nordberg and Per Ulrich Johansson who finished on 148 after rounds of 77 and 74 respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price, meanwhile, was actually level with Norman at the top of the leaderboard after a birdie at the long fifth only to tumble dramatically, with five bogeys over the next nine holes. Indeed, it took a birdie at the 16th, where he pitched to six feet below the hole, to salvage some comfort from a grim day. &quot;I was uncomfortable with my putting and I kind of lost my patience a bit,&quot; he said afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faldo finished disappointingly and it showed. Having started the day at two over par, birdies at the third and long fifth brought him to level. And he went on to be one under for the championship after another birdie at the 14th. With the prospect of a sparkling 67, however, he pulled his drive into heavy rough at the 8th, was six feet above the hole in three and misread the putt to card a closing bogey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After going directly to the practice ground, he said: &quot;I played all right, better than yesterday. I've given myself a chance but I will have to play better and putt better. The greens got a little bumpy and on the last three holes, anything was missable.&quot; He then added ruefully: &quot;I wish I hadn't hit that drive on 18. It makes me want to hit a couple of thousand practice balls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Langer claimed that he had played no better from tee to green than in an opening 74. The crucial difference was that the putts went down. &quot;I made some putts, for birdie and some putts for par,&quot; he said. &quot;I also got away with some things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Tway, in joint third place on 138 with Phil Mickelson was fourth here behind Norman entering the final round nine years ago, before slipping to a share of eighth place. But that performance gave him the confidence to challenge successfully for the USPGA Championship two months later, when he beat Norman at Inverness through a holed bunker shot in a dramatic climax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The course is going to get more difficult all the time &quot; he said after a second successive 69 that included birdies at the sixth (15 foot putt) and seventh (12 footer) and a lone bogey at the short 11th which he three putted from 30 feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shot further back is Bill Glasson, known for his irreverent attitude to authority. Making only his second US Open appearance in the last five years, he said: &quot;The idea of trying to qualify over 36 holes in one day, playing six hour rounds, is not for me, he said.  &quot;Mind you, I admire the guys who do it - from a distance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's performance should have been better, given an outward, 32 that included a birdie at the first, where he sank a 10 footer, and an eagle three at the long fifth, where he holed a chip from 10 yards off the green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman was &quot;very happy&quot; after the bonus of finishing his round with a birdie on the 18th. This was the product of one of those delicate &quot;sculled&quot; sandwedge shots from the fringe, which certain players have now raised to an art form. The 18 footer delivered the fifth birdie of a hugely impressive round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian also had two bogeys, which came as no surprise to him. &quot;I had myself mentally prepared for setbacks',&quot; he said. &quot;I knew I would have at least one bogey, it was only a question of where it would come and how I would react.&quot; His response was admirably positive. After dropping shots at the eighth and 10th, he hit back with a birdie at the short 11th where a glorious, nine iron tee shot finished only 18 inches from the pin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other birdies resulted - largely from spectacular putting. He sank a 20 footer at the second, an 18 footer at the next and a huge effort of 45 feet at the 14th. &quot;I love the course which I think is the best on the US Open rota,&quot; he enthused. &quot;But you've got to be patient that was the key to my success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norman insisted, however, that he retained much of his old aggression, to the extent that the only pin he didn't attack was the treacherous placement at the short 17th. &quot;The way the greens were today, you could go for the flag,&quot; he said. &quot;But if the weather stays this way, there won't be the same opportunities over the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on: &quot;Sure, I'd like to win another major, but I'm not going to force things. Sometimes, things just don't happen. I've learned to accept that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT'S a long, long way from Portmarnock to here. But watching the stunning talent of Phil Mickelson in the Walker Cup of 1991, it was easy to imagine him in a challenging position for the US Open. It was also typical of his talent that he could be up there, challenging for the halfway lead yesterday on his 25th birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mickelson has always relished the big occasion. I can recall the enormous fuss created at Pebble Beach three years ago when he chose the US Open to launch his professional career. And the acid comments of hardened scribes when he followed a brilliant opening round of 68 with a disastrous 81 to miss the halfway cut by some distance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The all American boy has matured somewhat since then the hard grind of the professional circuit has knocked much of the brashness out of his manner. But other things don't change. Like the well lacquered coiffure which stoutly resisted freshening winds midway through yesterday's round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ireland's Eoghan O'Connell played a halved match against Mickelson in the historic British and Irish Walker Cup triumph at Peachtree in 1989, he predicted that the talented American would become the next lefthanded player to win a major championship. Six years on, the prediction still holds good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though some observers took the view that a US Open crown was a natural progression from his victories in the 1989 and 1990 NCAA Championships and the 1990 US Amateur, Mickelson saw things very differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the time I was nine years old, watching the majors on television, I knew that my golfing life had to be geared towards them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all about getting into contention,&quot; he added. Which is precisely what he achieved yesterday by adding a level par second round of 70 to a fine, opening effort of 68 on Thursday. It was lunchtime when Mickelson finished and he relaxed in the knowledge that the wind would ensure somewhat subdued scoring for the remainder of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His progress so far has been particularly interesting for his play of the 544 yards 16th hole which he double bogeyed on Thursday and bogeyed yesterday - a total of three strokes over the two days.  Raymond Floyd, the 1986 champion, described it as: &quot;A monster, straight into the prevailing wind. A true, three shot par five which nobody is going to reach in two. You've got a tough drive, a tough lay-up and a lot of bunkers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mickelson has got to hope that it doesn't play the same, key role that it did in the destination of the title nine years ago when Floyd hit an eight iron third shot on the final day for what proved to be a winning birdie. &quot;Ideally, it gives you the best opportunity for birdie on the back nine,&quot; the 25 year old admitted. &quot;But I hit a bad second into the rough on Thursday and tried to get too clever with my wedge to the green yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happened, the 99 yards shot came up short of the target from where he chipped to six feet and missed the putt. It was his third bogey of a round that also yielded three birdies at the first, where he wedged to two feet; the 409 yard 10th, where he hit a six iron to 10 feet and the 415 yard 15th which he reduced to a drive, a nine iron second shot of 134 yards and a 15 foot putt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anything around par is a good score, said the player who, interestingly, rates Lahinch as his favourite links. &quot;This is a very difficult golf course - a great challenge. I like to play a course where par is a good score. You know that if you're suffering, there's a lot of other guys experiencing the same thing, or possibly worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Lema, the 1964 British Open champion and one of the game's great characters, expressed the opinion that competing in the US Masters was fun, but challenging for the US Open was work. Mickelson could empathise with that view. &quot;It's very easy to become defensive out there,&quot; he admitted. &quot;All it takes is a couple of bad shots and suddenly you're fighting to stay alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite undoubted talent, his US Open record is not particularly impressive. Indeed as we saw at Pebble Beach, there was never the slightest chance he would emulate the great Jack Nicklaus by making it his first victory as a professional. In two challenges as an amateur, he was tied 29th behind Hale Irwin at Medinah in 1990 and 55th behind Payne Stewart at Hazeltine the following year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broken legs sustained in a skiing accident, kept him out of the 1993 event and the only cut he has made as a professional came last year at Oakmont when a closing 79 pushed him down to a share of 47th place behind Ernie Els. Ironically, his only round in the sixties, prior to this week, was in the ill fated challenge at Pebble Beach.  So, he could be forgiven for thinking that the championship owed him something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is clearly not lacking in experience, given that victory in the Northern Telecom tournament at Tucson last January was the fifth of his professional career. &quot;I've had my chances of winning majors, as recently as this year's Masters (in which a last round of 73 eased him down to a share of seventh place),&quot; he said. &quot;These are the ultimate goals for all players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By making the cut last night, Mickelson pushed his professional earnings past the $ 2 million mark. One suspects that such a detail would be the least of his concerns, however, as he continues the quest of his first major triumph.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAST NIGHT'S scoreline in Eindhoven was an historic one for Irish men's hockey. It was the first time in 21 matches between the countries that the Netherlands had not won. The 1-1 draw was described by leading IHU official and former Ireland captain Dixon Rose as one of the most rousing performances he had ever seen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The match was the first of two internationals against the Dutch in Ireland's training week in the heartland of hockey in preparation for the European Championship in Dublin in August. The result will certainly be most encouraging. Veteran midfielders Jimmy Kirkwood and Martin Sloan played outstandingly while Robbie Taylor carried out much effective spoiling and Colin Hade tackled exceptionally well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarkably, against one of the world's leading sides, Ireland just about shaded the first half and deservedly took the load in the 22nd minute. Kirkwood blasted a long corner off goalkeeper Roland Jansen's pads and David McAnulty swept the loose ball into the not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good save by Jansen from Liam Canning prevented Ireland from increasing the lead and it was close to the interval before the visitors' goalkeeper Ivan. Bateman was fully tested. But five minutes into the second half he had no chance of keeping out the equaliser which was scored controversially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch intercepted an Irish free hit and broke away for Nico Van Pelt to fire in a shot. Bateman blocked it but the ball spun in the air and Wouter Delme crashed it into the net with his stick well above shoulder level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of losing their momentum, however, Ireland wore still able to attack with some menace. Ali Dunne had a short corner shot saved by Jansen and then Dunne was narrowly wide following a right wing cross by Daniel Clarke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the Dutch were relieved to share the evening's spoils.  Whether Ireland can again rise to the occasion in today's match at Amstelveen (as an extra attraction during the women's European Championship) remains to be seen. But at least a bogey dating back to 1949 has been broken. Among the previous best scores against the Netherlands won 2-3 in Amsterdam in 1965 and 0-1 in Belfast in 1969.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MOTIONLESS under the moon a heron stands on a pontoon by the bank of a creek. Soft winds whisper through the forest. A dog barks across the water. Not even a screech from an angry rival will disturb the bird's concentration as it &quot;lamps&quot; for fish by the magnetic light of a mooring beacon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching silently, there is nothing quite like having your senses tuned bay pitch, roll and wind. We had crept up the creek earlier to East Ferry, a haven in one of the world's finest natural harbours.  Cork is Cork; but it is always a &quot;discovery&quot; when approached by sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the term &quot;landfall&quot; is a deception. It is much more subtle than that. The eye fixes on a light shadow above the horizon.  Monochrome changes. Grey turns to brown and soon contrasts with green. Hours later, there may be trees, cliffs, a lighthouse above what seemed like a harmless headland, marking surging swells and treacherous rocks below.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in a thick fog, one can smell the cattle from miles out. The &quot;natives&quot; smell salt, bladderwrack, ozone. And the sea itself smells, of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have passed over it hundreds, of thousands of pounds worth of &quot;crop&quot; that many land locked states would die for. The weedlings to the hull as it does to the shoreline, but more of that later. We sail somewhere in between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our course? Clockwise from Dublin Bay. The aim? To take a snapshot of this island. For that reason, the vessel is not a powerboat, or a half tonne, twin hulled, hot bunking racing machine. Unlike Garda Michael Carroll, from Dungarvan, or Denis Doyle's Moonduster, we aim to break no records, we are not out to &quot;prove&quot; anything. If Gulliver, a 33 ft sloop, has one purpose, it is not just to explore a largely unspoilt 2,700 mile coastline - but to share a forgotten Milesian glimpse of Ireland from the outside in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registered in Dublin at nine tonnes (net) Thames measurement, the sloop is fully equipped. It has radar, satellite navigation, depth sounders, VHF radio, and a Pounds 2 pocket compass in case it all breaks down. The crew is a &quot;rolling&quot; one, but will include Frank. Miller, Irish Times photographer and keen dinghy sailor; Breeda Murphy, TCD student, mountaineer and qualified outdoor pursuits instructor from Leap, Co Cork; Ivor Davies, experienced sailor and our token Welshman; Fiachra O Marcaigh, Irish Times computer systems editor, if we make it past Donegal; Arthur Reynolds, retired journalist; and this reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the nature of the trip and the current debate onshore over borders and structures, we could have done worse than to enlist a politician. It was close. Sailing in to East Ferry this week, in Cork harbour we saw a tall, familiar, frame on the deck of a fine wooden ketch, Golden Apple. No, he wouldn't do, we reckoned: he was already &quot;convinced&quot;. Yet, with his Fastnet racing experience, the former marine Minister, now Minister of State for Finance, Hugh Coveney, would have been a handy catch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He strolled up the pontoon to greet us. To him, the Great Island haven of East Ferry is a very special place. Owned by a Cork farmer, Jim Butler, who is originally from Waterville, Co Kerry, it is one of the only primate marinas on this coastline. Mr Butler was an ocean yachtsman who completed his first Fastnet race in 1949 with - as he jokes now - a coal stove on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Coveney had sailed over with his family from Crosshaven. If still shaken by his demotion over the Bord Gais affair, he was philosophical. He was particularly touched bay messages of support from the coastline. One fisherman had phoned his wife, Pauline Coveney, to describe how he had felt when he heard the news of Mr Coveney's resignation from Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was out fishing on the Porcupine Bank, and there was a stunned silence in the wheelhouse, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was like the day that John F Kennedy was shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All round the coastline, there is mourning over his loss and who else would see it as such? In Arklow, first port of call en route from Dun Laoghaire, it had been hoped that he would steer through plans for a maritime park which would revitalise a town hit by unemployment. Arklow still guards its maritime tradition, vested now in the Tyrrell shipping company and the fishing fleet. Kate Tyrrell, who owned and often sailed the first schooner to fly the Irish tricolour in the 1920s, has been the subject of a new biography, written by her grandson from Inch, near Corey, John Mahon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is almost 10 years now since Jim Rees, author of a book on the transatlantic cable layer Captain Halpin, Tommy Myler, the harbourmaster and Mark Sinnott first talked about the park. The town museum, set up by Nick Tancred and Mark Sinnott, had been running out of room. A possible site for a maritime park was identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still much enthusiasm, if little sign of financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we heard more talk about it earlier this week, we watched children being taught basic skills in the inner harbour. There were splashes, shouts, serious efforts to row. Every one of them wore buoyancy aids. There were a few constant, gentle words of encouragement. &quot;Get up the fooking boat!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The track is a pencil line with Breton plotter on the charts now, but Gulliver has made good passage since. Our first little islands, after Dalkey were the Saltees where gannets and cormorants still multiply. They catch dinner in the plankton rich waters where two currents converge. Here, the sand banks thrown up by the Gulf Stream and St George's Channel have created a ship's graveyard So, although Prince Michael of the islands might have been at home, we kept moving along a coastline which has been designated as natural heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dunmore East, a busy harbour run by former Naval Service officer,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paddy Kavanagh, they were still talking about last year's visit by the QE2. The leviathan came in the fog. Hordes flocked to see it, and there were bus trips for the passengers to Waterford Crystal and Mount Juliet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunmore, with its noisy kittiwake colony, was as congested as ever. It is a natural destination for a growing number of visiting.  British yachts. While there are still proposals for marinas on the Barrow estuary, the new shipping terminal for Waterford port at Cheekpoint has churned up mudbanks. Nearby Kilmore Quay has been transformed by a Pounds 3 million harbour development. There is much support there now for a complementary marina scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the Dunmore East harbour wall has collapsed under pressure from forklift trucks serving the busy fishing port. The Treminou, owned by the legendary tuna skipper, Alan Glanville, was up on the synchrolift. As he looked out on his boat from his garden on the hill, the skipper spoke of his views on the Spanish fishing fleet, for which he has tremendous respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also recalled a conflict off the headland between fleets from the Republic and Northern Ireland, around 1966, when the Northern vessels were encouraged to fish in Southern waters. After an initial clash, the fleets came to an amicable agreement. Some still call it the real Battle of Baginbun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN you spill soup, you have to spill wind. On the nine hour passage to Cork harbour, Gulliver was whipped along by that north westerly breeze. The day divided now into tides and weather forecast, we kept watch for salmon nets - of which there were relatively few.  And that anti cyclone was still &quot;slow moving&quot; across the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Butler is Mr Marina Man. Ever since he laid down his pontoons on a fore shore licence for East Ferry in July 1980. He has been visited by delegation after delegation from &quot;every creek from here to Dingle&quot;. Contrary to prevailing opinion, a marina is not an instant money spinner, he told us. There is the lack of fixity of tenure, and the fact that the tax system is geared in favour of sailing clubs. He cannot plan long term. &quot;If I make a Pounds 1 profit, I have to pay 40 pence in corporation tax,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that to be successful, a marina has to be located close to &quot;a resident population of boats&quot;. Ireland offers unrivalled cruising grounds for yachts, but a fragile rim can quickly be spoiled by floating &quot;parks&quot; for yachts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many places could offer facilities with something more modest,&quot; Mr Butler said. &quot;A 50 to 100 foot pontoon will tie up 20 to 30 boats.  It can be taken up in the winter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following morning, we slipped our moorings, crossed the harbour, gliding past the spectre of Irish Steel. Three French navy ships had tied up at Cobh on a courtesy call. We were bound to visit an old friend. He had arranged a modest berth for us, alongside the Naval Service flagship, LE Eithne, in the Haulbowline base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we clambered over the side, we heard music. We were being piped aboard!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here again, there are dreams and plans. The Naval Service has been kept busy with fishery patrols and detentions. The former Minister had committed the Government to purchasing an additional two to three ships, as part of a surveillance package to be considered by an EU fisheries council this week. How would the new embargo on public spending affect recruitment of crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another proposal, which would seek to link the service more closely with the Cork community. Once again, the former Minister had given support in principle for a maritime school at a Naval Service site in Ringaskiddy. The aim is to teach nautical skills, and set standards for sail training - to Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) levels - at a time of growth in the leisure industry and increasing emphasis on maritime safety. If approved - and is still and if - it is intended to complement, rather than conflict with the national fisheries training school run by Board Iascaigh Mhara in Greencastle, Co Donegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we cast off and set sail to take advantage of the prevailing winds sweeping north east, we caught sight of a fine craft up on the naval slip. The Brime, a 65 foot cruiser, was apprehended by the Naval Service two years ago with a Pounds 20 million cargo of cannabis aboard. The vessel has been awarded to the service for sail training, but it is still a ward of court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time you read this, we will have Kerry accents. At some stage, we may be weather bound. The course by Kinsale, Castletownshend, Cape Clear's and Crookhaven is set for the Skelligs.  Here is yet another story to tell; a story of monks, mountaineers, and the slow but steady pace of the Office of Public Works restoration programme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By ROBERT O'BYRNE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEEKEND; Pg. Supplement page 8</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MORE than anything else Margaret Drabble's latest work is reminiscent of those worthy but now largely unread hagiographies which were such a feature of the late 19th century. Like a latter-day Augustus Hare, she lavishes attention on her subject in the belief that no detail of his life is too small to merit exclusion. Of late, accumulated information has usually been employed as a weapon by biographers engaged in acts of iconoclasm, but Drabble's anachronistic approach to the form means that her book is almost entirely devoid of criticism - even of the literary kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the Victorian tone, it's appropriate that comparisons should be made between Wilson and Dickens, even if these are unsustainable; better to settle for some competent storytelling talent such as Mrs Oliphant or Mrs Humphrey Ward. Wilson's only direct link with the Victorians is a fondness for an extravagantly large cast of characters, and social satire. Among 20th-century writers, he could be placed alongside Muriel Spark or Kingsley Amis, except that their work is far less disparate in subject matter than his own; as a chronological reading of Wilson reveals, each successive novel, although eminently readable and entertaining, bears little resemblance to its predecessor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the early books, Hemlock and After and Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, share certain similarities, subsequent novels including The Middle Age of Mrs Eliot and The Old Men at the Zoo suggest that Wilson mistakenly wanted to avoid the creation of his own universe.  Starting each time with an entirely fresh environment meant that unlike Dickens or even (more aptly) Barbara Pym, Wilson never acquired a loyal following of readers who could confidently predict what each new book would bring. None of his novels can be condemned on the grounds of poor craftsmanship but they suggest an author forever looking for fresh challenges rather than refining the same small piece of ivory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to make his situation still more difficult, Wilson, having started writing relatively late, of his own volition quickly became part of England's literary establishment, taking to the touring lecture circuit with relish. Hardly had he achieved old age than he was firmly fixed as the grand old man of English letters; gratifying to his vanity, no doubt, but extremely detrimental to his craft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder, then, that even while he was still alive his reputation was in abeyance and friends including Margaret Drabble were campaigning to keep Wilson's work in publication. This biography is, unabashedly, a further part of that effort but it is unlikely to give the cause much help. The truth is that Wilson will remain a minor figure whose best work is of continued interest principally because it reflects so well the atmosphere of Britain in the years immediately after the second World War. It is a measure of his reputation's decline that today he is liable to be confused with A.N.  Wilson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that any such confusion would be made by Drabble, who, seemingly, has devoted the past seven years to this book. As is so often the case, the most interesting chapters are the first, in which Wilson's rackety childhood as the youngest of six sons born to feckless Edwardian parents is explored. After drifting through school and university, he managed to secure a job as librarian in the British Museum, but it wasn't until suffering a nervous breakdown while deciphering codes in wartime that he began to write.  Astonishingly, from the very first short story, &quot;Raspberry Jam&quot;, Wilson had a completely confident literary voice. When his first volume of stories, The Wrong Set, was published in 1949, Sean O'Faolain wrote that &quot;he can write as a duck can swim&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To continue the simile, Wilson took to being an author like a duck to water. He obviously loved seeing his name in print and worked harder than most writers to ensure that he was part of Britain's postwar literary world. In this arena, he reached his apotheosis when a special professorial post was created for him at the University of East Anglia. No wonder that Drabble writes &quot;being a Man of Letters and a Moral Authority. . . could become a fulltime job&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite enjoying a wide circle of friends, Wilson was not an altogether attractive figure. His gifts of mimicry were well-known and feared - he enjoyed creating feuds between mutual friends and, he could harbour a grudge long after it should have been allowed to reach its conclusion. All this and far too much more is recounted in mind-numbing detail by Drabble; as befits the wife of serial biographer Michael Holroyd, she does not believe in sifting out the trivial but serves up all research as being of equal importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her style is also shockingly slap-dash and given to hilarious generalisations; of a family which befriended Wilson, she writes that in their household &quot;brilliant conversation flowed freely after diner to the perfume of expensive cigars&quot;. Wilson himself advised Drabble against this biography, tell her: &quot;you've better things to do with your time, dear girl&quot; such as improving her style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final chapters, still far too long-winded, are rather moving as she tells of Angus Wilson's sad decline into old age. He and his companion Tony Garrett mistakenly moved to France and then had to face serious illness without their friends. Five years ago in the Independent, there was an appeal for financial support to help Wilson who had by now moved to a nursing home back in Britain. &quot;Has the world forgotten what a great writer Angus Wilson was?&quot; asked Rose Tremain in the piece she wrote to accompany this appeal. The loyalty of such friends is admirable and touching but the truth is that Wilson the author was never great. Not even Drabble's tome can make him that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Box, which is now so fashionable, should be trimmed in June or July. If it is cut late in the season - September or October - winter frost can damage the new growth leaving bare, ugly patches which will not recover until the following year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Minister for Culture, Mr Higgins, has withdrawn his Planning objection to the Masonite timber-processing plant on the Shannon in Co Leitrim following concessions made by the company yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concessions emerged from discussions between representatives of Mr Higgins and the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The withdrawal of the objection, lodged with An Bord Pleanala, was welcomed by local TDs from all parties last night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Higgins, in a statement, said that his representatives were now satisfied that understandings had been reached, implementation of which would further ameliorate the visual impact of the development on the Shannon navigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am, therefore, satisfied, having regard to all of the constraints involved, that the company is continuing to take initiatives to achieve a better balance between industrial development and the preservation of Ireland's cherished green environment&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Higgins said that the company had made proposals which would encompass further mounding, landscaping and a five to six metres reduction in the ridge height of the main building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Higgins stated that he was giving notice that, in future, he would continue to defend our heritage while supporting economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Henry Coghlan, project manager for Masonite, welcomed Mr Higgins's decision to withdraw his objection and reiterated the company's commitment and sensitivity to the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fianna Fail spokesman on forestry, Mr John Ellis, welcomed the Minister's move but stated that if he had shown a little common sense at the start of the week and had investigated the issue comprehensively, there would have been no need for all of his procrastination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Gerry Reynolds (FG) said that he and others had been involved in helping to resolve the concerns expressed by Mr Higgins in the last two days and he was particularly grateful to the Taoiseach, Mr Bruton, for the very positive role he took in helping to bring about this satisfactory resolution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THERE was a decidedly mixed reaction to this year's Leaving Certificate home economics papers, which clearly disagreed with some teachers, while proving reasonably palatable to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The higher level scientific and social paper was &quot;overall a difficult paper&quot; and one with which students were not happy, according to Ms Ann McNicholl, TUI subject representative and a teacher in Carndonagh Community School, Co Donegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a paper which required a lot of in depth study,&quot; she said, singling out question two in particular as being too long.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Anne Marie Traynor, president of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics and a teacher in Deansrath Community College, Dublin, said that higher level paper was &quot;very testing&quot; and a definite test of students' ability. &quot;The questions required careful reading and analysis before attempting,&quot; she said. Question four in particular was &quot;tricky enough&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The higher level paper was very fair and certainly covered the whole course,&quot; said Ms Margaret McCluskey, ASTI subject convenor, who is based in Crumlin College of Business Studies, Dublin, of the scientific and social papers. At higher level, only question three, which covered physiology, might have stretched the brighter student, she said, but she pointed out that there is always a physiology question on the paper and that the subject is covered in detail on the course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She praised the improved layout of the papers, which have become increasingly student friendly in recent years. The important points were underlined and emphasised in bold for students, though the Department of Education's examiners have yet to include details of the marks awarded for each part of the question, common practice most other papers. In addition the time available to students to complete the paper should be increased to three hours, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing about home economics is that it's very relevant to students. They like it and they use it afterwards,&quot; she said. The ordinary level paper was also fine she added, and the clear separation of questions into their constituent parts was welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Maureen McGivern, a TUI subject representative and a teacher in Raphoe Vocational School, Co Donegal, said the ordinary paper was &quot;grand&quot;. She was glad to see a question on convenience foods, since it was important that students learned how to use them properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Ms McGivern hoped, she said, that the substitution of the traditional and general term &quot;media&quot; by the more specific &quot;press&quot; in the social section hadn't thrown some students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms McNicholl said that the ordinary level paper was &quot;much too difficult&quot;, particularly question four and the reference to ascorbic acid in question one. &quot;More consideration must be given to weaker students when wording questions on the ordinary level paper,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Ms Traynor noted the &quot;nice use of language and terminology&quot; in the ordinary level questions, which covered a good selection of topics in a straightforward way, she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE emphasis on healthy eating and consumer education on both Junior Cert home economics papers was warmly welcomed by teachers. Pupils, in turn, were happy with what they saw as reasonably easy exams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Maureen McGivern, TUI subject representative, said that the questions on the higher paper were searching but suitable for the level. Pupils at her school, Raphoe Vocational School, Co Donegal, reacted positively to the paper, she said, but thought the short answer questions were more difficult than the longer ones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identifying the BSI safety symbol caused some consternation among students, as its abstract nature does not lend itself to guessing. A number also came to grief with the word &quot;stereotype&quot;. However, the question on buying clothes went down very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Ann Marie Traynor, president of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics and a teacher in Deansrath Community College, Dublin, agreed that the short questions in the higher level were rather testing, but section B -was very straightforward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms McGivern described the question on milk as &quot;encouraging, an excellent question&quot;. She said that every child in the country probably answered the question on accidents in the home. Her only complaint was that there was far too much time for the paper - unnecessary given that the practical had already been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I imagine that the papers will be much better answered this year, as the practical was completed before Christmas and students had time to concentrate on the rest of the course,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Margaret McCluskey, ASTI subject representative, described both papers as student friendly. Some higher level students might have had difficulty with the concept of saturated and unsaturated fats, she said, and the short questions were a little difficult But overall it was a good paper - sensible and oriented to consumer education and healthy eating a good backup to the practical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms McCluskey made a plea to the Department of Education to consider funding the practical, a compulsory part of the exam for which students had to provide their own materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students at her school, Crumlin Business College, Dublin, were delighted with the ordinary level paper, Ms McCluskey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms McGivern said that the ordinary level paper was straightforward - students should be able to read and answer it without any great difficulty. &quot;Somebody went to a lot of trouble to make the paper clear and easy to read,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the short answer questions, students were quizzed on such practical matters as ballpoint pen and chewing gum stain removal, household waste recycling and measurements needed when buying jeans.  In the longer questions, jeans also featured: Peter bought a pair of black jeans that shrunk and faded at first washing. Examinees had to help him complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students were also asked for their views on how brand names influence a teenager's choice of clothing - a question many parents would like to see answered sensibly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms McGivern praised the budget and consumer questions in the short answer section on the ordinary level paper but said the diagram in question 17, which asked students to identify two threads, was unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overall, the papers are very different from the old Inter Cert.  They are much more readable and more practical. Students can relate to them,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, 34.5 per cent of school-leavers had jobs a year after leaving school, while 37.8 per cent were in further education.  Compared to the equivalent study of 1992 school-leavers, the proportion employed has dropped by 4.1 per cent, while those in further studies were up by 5.7 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unemployed school-leavers fell from 23.1 per cent in 1992 to 20 per cent last year. More than one-fifth were participating in State sponsored schemes such as Youthreach. The level of emigration among school-leavers has remained constant over the past three years and stood at 4.6 per cent in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Economic Status of School Leavers 1992-94 study shows that &quot;the trends of falling employment and increasing participation in further study are more marked among boys than girls. For example, there was a 7 per cent jump in participation in further education among boys, compared to 4 per cent for girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A longer-term analysis of patterns shows that the proportion of school-leavers in employment has halved over the past 15 years in 1980, seven out of every 10 leavers left school to start a job. The proportion going on to further study has doubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four out of five pupils completed senior cycle in 1994, up from 74.7 per cent in 1992. However, this means that one pupil in five still drops out early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Education hopes that 90 per cent of pupils will stay on to complete senior cycle, but the postponement of the Leaving Cert Applied Programme, which was to have been introduced this autumn, will make it more difficult to reach this target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 80 per cent of leavers entering the job market in 1994 with no qualifications were unemployed a year later, compared to 48 per cent of those with a Junior Cert and 29 per cent with the Leaving Cert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, unemployment was lower among pupils who had completed a VPT (vocational preparation and training) course in their senior cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry is the major provider of jobs for school-leavers, with more than one-third of those in full-time jobs working in this sector. Other sectors are distribution and personal services, while the proportion of school-leavers employed in banking and finance has fallen from 14 per cent in 1992 to under 8 per cent last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increasing number of school-leavers with full-time jobs are engaged in skilled or semi-skilled manual occupations. The next most common occupations are in services, followed by clerical work. Pupils who have completed a VPT course in senior cycle were four time more likely to work in clerical occupations than those who hadn't. As for schoolleavers with no formal qualifications, more than 60 per cent are engaged in manual occupations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of boy schoolleavers in employment were in skilled or semi-skilled manual occupations, compared to 18.3 per cent of girls. Female school-leavers were more likely to be working in service (37 per cent) or clerical occupations (32.7 per cent).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Bishop of Killaloe, Dr Willie Walsh, has warned that anyone who expects him to be &quot;a rebel, a dissenting voice in the Irish Hierarchy, will be disappointed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week Dr Walsh supported the Bishop of Ferns, Dr Brendan Comiskey, in his call for the issue of married priests to be considered by the Catholic Church. In February he wrote an article in The Furrow saying a number of outspoken things about clerical sex abuse, tolerance of dissent and priests' need for intimacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the Religious Press Association in Dublin yesterday, Bishop Walsh said he was &quot;not an intellectual or a theologian capable of originating new thinking&quot;. He felt he was &quot;being pushed into a box&quot; by the media and found that &quot;oppressive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Walsh said he often felt there were two Irelands. Rural Ireland tended to be ignored by the national media, except when something bad happened, and this &quot;often makes country people very angry with city people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there were two proposed solutions to the church's present problems he believed would not work. The first was the &quot;back to basics&quot; solution, based on the view that Ireland should return to the &quot;fine, strong church&quot; of the 1940s and 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled that of his 1952 Leaving Certificate class in St Flannan's College in Ennis, 22 out of 55 began to study for the priesthood. This year he did not know of one student going for the priesthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, the faith was very strong then, but it was at times a harsh and legalistic faith. I thought my Protestant neighbours would go to hell and that my dad was threatened with the same for going to the funeral of a kindly Protestant neighbour. He knew it too but he still went. I don't share the modern rubbishing of such a faith, but I will argue that it was not as perfect as the back to basics' people would want us to believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also critical of the small number of Catholics who &quot;go beyond what I regard as acceptable Christian behaviour from the annoying anonymous letter, to the hurtful suggestions that you are in favour of divorce, homosexual activity, sex before marriage or more hurtful still, that you are only seeking cheap popularity.&quot; He said around 5 per cent of the correspondence he received following his Furrow article was of this type.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second solution he felt would not work was the &quot;personal freedom - religion is a private matter&quot; solution. He said this &quot;over-emphasis on personal freedom, without the accompanying responsibility for the results of my actions on myself and others is surely responsible for a great deal of our difficulties in today's Western world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a philosophy of the survival of the fittest and let the weak go to the wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Walsh suggested that the way for priests to overcome their present problems was &quot;to try to be with the people, sharing their struggles, their brokenness and their joys&quot; equally, to allow people to share their struggles as priests, thus admitting their vulnerability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Minister for the Marine, Mr Barrett, expressed dissatisfaction last eight with a European Commission offer of Pounds 8 million in aid towards Ireland's surveillance costs when the Spanish fishing fleet gains access to the &quot;Irish Box&quot; next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Luxembourg after a meeting of EU fisheries ministers, Mr Barrett said he was holding out for a better offer than the Pounds 1.6 million per year over five years proposed by the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are making no apologies for seeking additional aid. We are carrying out surveillance on behalf of the EU. With 16 per cent of Community waters we have a big job to do,&quot; said Mr Barrett.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister said he wanted to carry out, a full assessment of the costs facing the Government before negotiating the amount needed to cover operational expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveillance will have to be stepped up dramatically from January to enforce new controls when Spanish vessels gain access to the Irish Box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland secured the promise of aid towards the operational costs of extra surveillance last December when the terms for abolition of the Irish Box were negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Government officials said last night that acceptance of the Commission's offer at this stage could jeopardise Ireland's bid for a substantial share of Pounds 156 million EU, fund being set up to pay for capital costs related to increased surveillance and policing. The fund, to be shared out between member-states affected will pay for the purchase of new inspection vessels and sophisticated radar equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Barrett meanwhile welcomed the decision taken last night which will oblige the Spanish to distribute their fishing effort in Irish waters between the south-west and north-western areas. Of the 40 Spanish vessels to be given access to the Irish Box at anyone time, a maximum of 32 will be allowed to operate in the rich fishing grounds of the south and south-west coast. &quot;We were concerned about a concentration in the south-west area,&quot; Mr Barrett said. Spain, which wanted complete freedom to fish in Irish waters, opposed the arrangement but was out-voted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spanish also failed to stop agreement on new limits on how much, fishing each member state does in the EU's western waters. The curbs, calculated according to fleet capacity and time spent at sea, are designed to protect stocks then the Spanish gain full access to Irish and British waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers deferred talks on new fishing controls which are also intended to curtail over fishing in the Irish Box.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NO ONE is neutral on Bob McCartney. His opponents brand him arrogant and aggressive. He is a power hungry demagogue, they say, who will wreak havoc in Northern politics to satisfy his ego. He has been called &quot;a secular Paisley&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His admirers are equally passionate. They speak of a warm hearted, sincere, exuberant man. No one doubts that he is articulate, intelligent and ambitious. He is regularly described as the new Carson, someone who can save unionism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A politics lecturer at the University of Ulster, Mr Arthur Aughey, says: &quot;What everyone agrees on is that, love him or hate him, he has charisma. In the general ordinariness of Northern politics he is extraordinary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob McCartney (59), one of the North's leading barristers, is a Shankill Road boy made good. He won a scholarship to Queen's University, Belfast. His father worked in the shipyard, hid mother in a mill. He was orphaned at 18, which led, he says, to &quot;me becoming very much my own man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He met his wife, Maureen, when he was still at school. &quot;I was one of the roughest boys and she was one of the gentlest girls. She was a great civilising influence on me. They have four grown up children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a QC, Mr McCartney specialises in civil suits. He successfully defended the SDLP MP for West Belfast, Dr Joe Hendron, against an attempt to unseat him for electoral malpractices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He unsuccessfully contested the North Down constituency twice before. He was expelled from the Ulster Unionists in 1987 after a series of confrontations with the party hierarchy. He remains popular with the grassroots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has admitted that he wants to &quot;demolish&quot; the UUP leadership, whose &quot;incompetence&quot;, he says, has damaged the unionist cause. The party was duped by the British government over the Framework Document and then, even more damningly, failed to unite with the DUP when the situation became obvious, he argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His opponents say that he is motivated by revenge. They claim that he contested North Down because he believed that a victory would hasten the demise of the UUP leader, Mr Jim Molyneaux. The DUP supported his election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McCartney says that he wants to define &quot;a new Union&quot;, free from the sectarianism of the past and attractive to Catholics. It should be about &quot;the best social and economic deal possible and a pluralist democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is an integrationist and believes that the main British parties should organise here. He would consider taking the Labour whip in the House of Commons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McCartney supports parity of esteem for Catholics and Protestants but not for unionism and nationalism - &quot;it's ridiculous, they are fundamentally opposing ideologies&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board has also announced the name of the liquidator who will be proposed to wind up the company. He is Mr Tom Grace of Price Waterhouse, Chartered Accountants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of unions met four of the five directors of the Irish Press yesterday for the first face to face meeting since the start of the current crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the directors said it was their view the liquidation would have taken place regardless of the industrial dispute which following the sacking of the group finance editor, Mr Colm Rapple, and that the current crisis was caused by the Competition Authority's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That report recommended that Independent Newspapers be forced to divest itself of its share holding in the Irish Press, and while the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Mr Bruton, has yet to announce his decision in relation to the report, he has said he would not allow further investment by the Independent in the Irish Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without further investment by Independent Newspapers and with increasing debts, the continued solvency of the company was in serious doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board, it is believed, told the unions there was now no possibility of stopping the appointment of a liquidator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the unions met the deputy chairman of Independent Newspapers, Mr John Meagher, the chief executive, Mr Liam Healy and the managing director, Mr David Palmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Independent Newspapers said it had been a private meeting and no statement would be issued, but it is understood the unions were told that the company had no plans to invest more money in the Irish Press &quot;at this stage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National onion of Journalists (NUJ) yesterday appealed a decision of the Department of Social welfare which has refused to give payments to the 150 journalists at the Irish Press because they are involved in an industrial dispute. The NUJ has claimed its members have been locked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish Press board announced last night that a meeting of creditors of Irish Press Newspapers will take place on Wednesday, June 28th, at the Point Depot at 10 a.m. Earlier, a meeting of shareholders of Irish Press Newspapers will be held to liquidate the company. The shareholders are Irish Press Plc and Independent Newspapers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Fianna Fail spokesman on social welfare, Mr Joe Walsh, welcomed the principle in the Social Welfare Bill that the spouse and children left behind following divorce should not be disadvantaged in welfare entitlements. But, he said, the Bill was full of anomalies and the Pounds 1 million which the Minister estimated marital breakdown would add to welfare costs in the first five years after divorce was clearly too low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divorce would exert a substantial influence on the socio-economic fabric of society, with those already financially deprived being most at risk. There would be more lone parents. &quot;In many instances the State will have to provide extra housing facilities, rent and mortgage interest subsidies, while demand for the family income supplement is certain to escalate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill had a strong element of conditionality, referring to &quot;entitlements&quot; rather than &quot;rights&quot;. That was the weakest form of protection possible for women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were around 75,000 people now living with the tragedy of broken marriages. &quot;Marital breakdown is about a lot more than just achieving and getting a divorce.&quot; It required sensible and effective legislation relating to marriage, children, maintenance, legal aid and family courts. The State should be aiming to allow people to live their lives in dignity and without financial and legal harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Helen Keogh (PD, Dun Laoghaire) said the Bill was &quot;minimalist in the extreme&quot; and addressed one narrow requirement the Labour Party's desire to reassure social welfare recipients that introducing divorce would not impoverish them. Of course, divorce should not impoverish the poor, but that should have been achieved as part of a package of social welfare reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government should also be honest about the costs. &quot;This measure is going to be an expensive one. If a couple married in their early 20s and separated amicably after a short period, then 40 to 60 years later, when one of them died, the other would be entitled to the survivor's pension. Had the Government worked out the cost implications of this? she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experience in other countries showed that marital breakdown led to a reduction of the income levels of family members. &quot;This is an unpalatable pill for the Government to have to swallow in the run-up to the referendum, but it is true and it must be faced.&quot; It was not divorce, but marriage breakdown itself, which caused the financial hardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Minister for Equality and Law Reform wishes to fulfil his newly stated ambition to guard the institution of marriage, he should do so by providing real, practical support to healthy families, not by inserting a formula of words into the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Michael Woods, Fianna Fail spokesman on equality and law reform, said the Bill was neither imaginative nor progressive. &quot;It seems to be consistent with the present Government's cut-back mentality. It is barely adequate to meet the needs of the projected &quot;divorce jurisdiction&quot; and the impending referendum. An opportunity to enhance the status of the family and support for married women has been lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Frances Fitzgerald (FG, Dublin South East) criticised Fianna Fail's &quot;ambivalent&quot; stance on the Bill. What was needed now was recognition of the reality of separated spouses and support for the family, such as the Government was providing through the Family Mediation Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jim Kemmy (Lab, Limerick East) said the Bill would help to eliminate the &quot;poor law mentality&quot;. It was a civilised response to the people whose marriages were broken down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Kathleen Lynch (DL, Cork North Central) said that at present there was a two-tier system of family breakdown - those who could afford a foreign divorce abroad or avail of a judicial separation in the State. &quot;Those who can't afford it get a barring order, or continue to live in misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oireachtas should ensure that divorce would be a last, not the first, resort. There must be increased attention to family mediation services to provide support for couples and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The unpalatable reality is that the number of marriage break-downs is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Yet, as in so many areas of society, constitutional reform has lagged behind social change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Charlie Flanagan (FG, Laois-Offaly) said the Bill was a vital part of the jigsaw that must be in place before the divorce referendum. Big changes in family law had been made since 1986 but these were not widely understood. He welcomed the plans of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to have a series of seminars before the referendum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Government spend on social welfare is almost Pounds 11 million per day, the Minister for Social Welfare, Mr De Rossa, told the Oireachtas Select Committee on Social Affairs yesterday during a discussion on the estimates for the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department, he said, provides weekly payments to 800,000 people which in turn benefits almost 1.5 million when adult and child dependants are taken into account.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Joe Walsh, the Fianna Fail Social Welfare spokesman criticised the tow level of increases included in this year's estimates for social welfare recipients. He said spending in other areas was out of control and the Government had caused economic wreckage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PD spokesman, Mr Peadar Clohessy, said a fundamental review of the entire system of social welfare was necessary and he called for a comprehensive debate on the whole issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister told Mr Walsh that 38 staff in the Department had earned in excess of Pounds 11,000 last year in overtime. They were mainly senior staff involved in the computer area who were subject to call-out at any time to rectify faults.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LEADERS of the worlds richest nations gathered in Halifax in Nova Scotia for a day of boat trips and ceremonial tours at the start of a two-day Group of Seven (G7) summit beset by bitter rows among its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit has been hit by disputes between the US and France over Bosnia the US and Japan over trade Britain and Germany over the fate a Shell oil rig, and France and the rest over nuclear tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rain which has soaked this Atlantic sea-port for four days lifted yesterday, but the summit was overshadowed by the storm clouds over Sarajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an offensive coinciding with the G7 summit, Bosnian forces launched an offensive against the Serbs because, in the words of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, the international community had done nothing to prevent the &quot;catastrophe&quot; that had befallen the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French officials last night warned the US that attempts by the US Congress to stop funding for the new rapid reaction force in Bosnia could jeopardise a new UN resolution required to set it up. The US must pay a proportion of UNPROFOR costs and faces a new bill of millions of dollars for the strike force. This is opposed by Republican Congressional leaders, Mr Bob Dole and Mr Newt Gingrich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnia will dominate the political talks which take place this evening and tomorrow when the leaders of the G7, the US, Germany, Britain, Canada, Italy, Japan and France are joined by Russian President Boris Yell sin. Canada is strongly hinting it wants to pull out, after its UNPROFOR battalion was immobilised by yesterday's fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, headed for a showdown today with the German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, over controversial plans to bury a polluted oil rig at sea (see page 13). Arriving in Halifax, Mr Major said he would not bow to German demands that it ban the Shell oil group from consigning the Brent Spar rig to the depths of the North Sea off Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as I am aware, the disposal of the Brent Spar is in accordance with international law,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were a company I would not do anything which would hurt my business,&quot; a clearly angry Dr Kohl said. The German Finance Minister, Mr Theo Waigel, was even blunter, strongly advising Shell to change its mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French president, Mr Jacques Chirac, made an aggressive entry to his first G7 after his announcement of a resumption of nuclear-weapons testing in the South Pacific. The sudden decision, apparently taken to assert French independence from the United States, was denounced in bitter terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Japanese prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, said France's decision &quot;betrays the confidence of nonnuclear states&quot; and Tokyo was calling again for an end to all nuclear testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada also called on France not to reverse the 1992 decision of the French socialist government to respect a world-wide moratorium.  Canadian Foreign Minister, Mr Andre Quellet, said the French turnaround would &quot;set the ball rolling&quot; among other nuclear countries to resume testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chirac defended his decision, saying he was committed to signing the treaty after a limited number of tests between now and May next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the summit cent re, Greenpeace activists protested against nuclear testing and other environmental issues by making part of nearby Granville Street into a chess board, with dwarf pines as pawns, spruce trees as knights and cedars as kings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chess is about strategy and power and the G7 is about too much power in the hands of seven people who eat expensive food while the third world starves,&quot; said a Green peace protestor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of 150 Canadian Indians marched on the summit centre to protest that the concerns of native peoples were not being addressed by Canada and other G7 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major will meet separately on the fringes of the summit today. They might resolve the problem of finding dates for the US President's planned visit to London and Belfast in the autumn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G7 leaders will examine how best to strengthen the 50-year-old twin institutions of world finance, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and the United States wants to raise questions about the creaking United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collapse of the Mexican peso, the Barings bank closure and the Bosnian crisis have called into question the ability of these international organisations to cope in the post-Cold War era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade ministers have been excluded from the summit but trade ministers from Canada, Japan, the United States and the European Union headed for Halifax at the last minute to give impetus to talks on global reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five world leaders arrived for the summit yesterday Mr Clinton, Mr Major, Mr Chirac Dr Kohl and the Italian Prime Minister Mr Lamberto Dini. The Canadian prime minister and host, Mr Jean Chretien, and the Japanese prime minister came to Halifax the previous day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU Commission President, Mr Jacques Santer, is also in Halifax, having travelled from Washington where he had talks with President Clinton in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each delegation was escorted from the Shearwater Jetty by Coast Guard vessel to historic properties where they were presented with eagle feathers by two chiefs of the Mi'kmac and other first nations in North America, grand chief Ben Silliboy and grandkeptin Alex Denny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton and his wife Hillary went on a short walkabout among cheering crowds in the town centre, accompanied by the Nova Scotia prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Yeltsin arrives in Halifax later today and the summit will then change from G7 to G8, bringing together the eight world leaders for political discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of unspecified threats, security was exceptionally tight at the summit and parts of the centre of Halifax resembled a penal camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security area around the conference centre was designated a &quot;red zone&quot;. Over 2,000 Canadian Mounted Police have been drafted into the town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EGYPTIAN archaeologists have discovered some of the most intact mummies ever found from the Roman period in an oasis in the Egyptian desert, a find that should shed new light on the Greek and Roman period in Egypt and the mummification process during this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the most beautiful mummies from the Roman period we've seen in our life said Mr Zahi Hawass, a Supreme Council of Antiquities official. &quot;We haven't discovered something like this before.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archaeologists believe the tomb may be the burial place of a royal family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the mummies is an Egyptian king, Mr Hawass said, because he is wearing a gold leaf crown depicting the hawk-like God, Horus, the symbol for a king. Two cobras are located to the right and left of Horus to protect him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archaeologists removed three of the eight 2.000 year old mummies from the tomb last week after its discovery in the Bahariya Oasis.  320 km south-west of Cairo, where the only temple in Egypt for the great Greek leader, Alexander the Great, was built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mummy of a woman and what is believed a child were also removed from the tomb in a painstaking effort to get the mummies in tightly sealed cases before any air could reach them. The next challenge is removing the remaining five mummies Mr Hawas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other specialists confirmed the find's importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, it is significant,&quot; said Professor Ahmed Etman, chairman of the Greek and Latin Studies Department at Cairo University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just to find a mummy is something significant, because you don't find mummies every day&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These mummies are in uniquely good condition, according to Mr Hawass, because no grave robbers had pilfered the tomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman mummies are also usually in inferior condition to Pharoanic mummies, Mr Hawass said, because Pharoanic priests did not share all their techniques with the Ptolemites after Alexander the Great entered Egypt in 332 BC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the Romans, who ruled Egypt next from 32 BC to 395 AD, also had incomplete information about the mummification process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mummies, wrapped in linen with brightly-painted gold leaf collars and masks, have Greco-Roman features with big eyes, ringed in black, a hairstyle cut with a fringe, and the strong nose often described as Roman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archaeologists found this tomb by accident. It was the first in the area to be opened. They were excavating for Coptic artefacts around a ninth-century Coptic church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will excavate 12 more tombs in the area and expect to find more mummies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This find comes amidst a number of significant discoveries in Egypt recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just this week Egyptian archaeologists found a pharaopic tomb believed to belong to a king from the dynasty in the southern province of Luxor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GERMAN politicians united yesterday to condemn plans by the Shell oil company to dump a disused oil rig in the North Sea amid mounting calls for an international boycott of Shell filling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell insists that the sinking of the Brent Spar oil rig will not damage the environment and the company, which recorded profits in excess of Pounds 4 billion last year, says it would cost too much to take it ashore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace activists, who have been circling the platform in the research ship, Altair, claim that the rig is carrying 130 tonnes of toxic waste and that its sinking will cause irreversible damage to marine life in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These spectacular new forms of pollution are a setback for all the efforts to protect our seas. Germany spends a lot of money to play its part in protecting the North Sea - other shoreline states must also do their duty,&quot; Germany's Foreign Minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Finance Minister, Mr Theo Waigel, were expected to raise the Brent Spar issue with British representatives during the G7 summit of leading industrial nations which began in Halifax yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Waigel told a German newspaper that he regarded the sinking as unacceptable, notwithstanding the support Shell has received from the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Europe can show itself capable of negotiating solutions in issues such as this, this would be a motivation for us all,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kohl was more cautious in his comments, remarking on the economic consequences the controversy could have for Shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were a company I would not do anything which would hurt my business,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue has provoked greater outrage in Germany than anywhere else in Europe and Shell is reporting a sharp drop in profits in Germany in recent days due to a nationwide boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from the oil rig have dominated the front pages of most popular newspapers this week and public comment has been almost exclusively critical of Shell. Some newspapers have even been publishing details of Greenpeace bank accounts, urging readers to help fund the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six shots were fired at a Shell service station near Frankfurt on Wednesday but police say that nobody was hurt and there was little damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell filling stations in Berlin were deserted yesterday as some managers predicted a 70 per cent fall in profits by the end of the month unless the boycott is called off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One colleague of mine was threatened that his filling station would be blown up,&quot; claimed Mr Wolfgang Baer, who runs the Shell station at Karl Marx Allee in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians from all sides have voiced support for the Shell boycott and Mr Michael Mueller, a spokesman on the environment for the opposition Social Democrats, called for an emergency debate in the Bundestag on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Germany's leading actors and TV stars have publicly condemned the planned sinking of the rig and even the pro business Liberal Free Democratic Party has joined the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've ordered that, until further notice, none of the staff cars at our headquarters should use Shell and our employees are boycotting too,&quot; the party chairman, Mr Guido Westerwelle, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) has called on Shell to compensate its 1,700 filling station managers for loss of revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party's general secretary, Mr Bernd Protzner, says he has changed brands in support of the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if I had to leave my car sitting there without petrol and had to walk on with a reserve can, I'd pass a Shell station on the way and fill up somewhere else,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell's German division, which cancelled a national advertising campaign yesterday, claims the boycott is unfair because it has no control over the actions of its British sister company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell UK appears determined to press on with the dumping, insisting that to destroy the rig onshore would risk causing even greater environmental damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court in Edinburgh issued an arrest warrant yesterday for Mr Jonathan Castle, the captain of the Greenpeace ship monitoring Brent Spar, following his failure to reveal the names of fellow activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace said that the rig was still being towed towards its dumping site yesterday and predicted that, under current weather conditions, it would arrive there next Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation called for motorists in other countries to follow the German lead in avoiding Shell filling stations amid signs that the boycott is gathering pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell has sought to stem the tide of departing customers by cutting the price of diesel by one pfennig but, as one filling station worker in Berlin put it, &quot;Nobody fills up at Shell anymore except the fish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a call to boycott Shell products has come from Green MEP, Ms Patricia McKenna, in protest at the company's planned deep water dumping of the oil rig off the north west coast of Scotland.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By FINTAN O'TOOLE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Pg. 16</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1167 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THERE are fewer travellers in Ireland than there are Irish people in Germany.  The latest estimates I have seen for the latter category is 25,000, for the former 22,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures suggest the paradox of Irish attitudes to travellers, on display in all their disgraceful virulence at Moate we are one of the most unsettled peoples in Europe, yet we are also one of the European societies least tolerant of unsettled people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We expect, without a thought, that our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, will be welcomed in societies where they are migratory strangers. Yet many of us apparently find the notion of migratory strangers in our midst intolerable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contradictions go on. Travellers are resented because they are seen as subversive of law and order, yet people at Moate like people in Bantry, Bray, Glenamaddy, Navan, Tuam, and Enniscorthy in recent times see no irony in breaking the law or disrupting order in anti-traveller protests. Travellers might be disorderly, so let's smash the glass doors of the council offices in Athlone. Travellers clutter up our lovely roads with their caravans and trailers, so let's block all the traffic on the Dublin-Galway road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travellers are resented because they are nomads, yet a strong undercurrent in the Moate protests is the idea that a Pounds 46,000 house is too good for a traveller family. Travellers living in rat-infested dumps are dirty barbarians. Travellers living in decent houses are pampered parasites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travellers are supposed to &quot;be like us&quot;, yet not so like us that they might live next door: 70 per cent of people surveyed in ESRI research &quot;would be reluctant to buy a house next to an itinerant&quot;.  Travellers are supposed to simultaneously integrate into our society and stay as far away from us as possible. Simple, isn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SO what is going on here? Whatever it is, it is not what it pretends to be a fear of being swamped by travellers. Ireland is a society with a tiny number of nomads. Compared with European countries such as Spain or the former communist states of central and eastern Europe, all of which have between half a million and two million nomads, Ireland is not awash with unsettled people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Switzerland, for God's sake, has more nomads than Ireland. So what is going on is not really about travellers at all but about the rest of us, the &quot;settled&quot; people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past 50 years, Irish society has been tidying itself up.  Slowly but very effectively we have been ordering public space in such a way as to reflect the divisions of class and wealth much more clearly than before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, at a time of vastly greater ease of travel and communication, we have constructed a division of space in which the haves and have nots see much less of each other than they would have done in pre-war Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rural Ireland, many of what one Moate resident called the &quot;inferior people&quot; on the Gay Byrne Show have either disappeared through emigration or been effectively marginalised. Farm labourers, as a class, have all but vanished. Subsistence farmers, what used to be called the Irish peasantry, have sharply declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1971 and 1986, the number of farmers with under 30 acres declined by 62 per cent. Put crudely, the idea that the Irish countryside contains a large number of people on the economic and social edge has been less and less obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In urban Ireland there has been a separate but parallel process at work. A large and apparently permanent underclass of the unemployed and underprivileged has been created by the social change from which a majority of the population has benefited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it has also, conveniently, been removed from the public space of middle-class Ireland. The poor, for the most part, have been shifted from inner cities and out to reservations in the badlands, where they are expected to stay put. Thus, for instance, joy at the news that the DART system was to be extended to Greystones was tempered for some residents by fears that the nice green trains might also be funnels down which gurriers from Darndale might pour into their neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modernising Ireland has thus been a process of separating out the intertwined strands of class and status in Irish society. Travellers have been victims of this process, for in spite of all the talk of integration and assimilation, they have been placed at a greater and greater distance from the economic and social mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The services they once provided for the settled community temporary farm labouring, horse dealing, metal working, music have become either redundant or specialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as well as being victims of the process they also challenge it. On the one hand, their unsettled culture means they cross the new boundaries we have constructed so carefully and deliberately. The poor in Ireland are supposed to either stay in their place, out of sight, or get out. Travellers do neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other, they remind us of where we are coming from. The greatest paradox of the travellers' situation, indeed, is that the contempt for them in parts of the settled community is self-contempt.  Travellers are the closest group in Ireland to the way the country was before the industrial revolution of the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over a whole range of indicators the importance of the extended family, the rate of births outside marriage just a third of that amongst the settled population, life expectancy travellers in the 1990s live lives close to those of settled people in the 1940s. In important respects, when it looks at travellers, Irish society is looking at its own preWhitaker self.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT the upsurge of agitation against travellers shows is that, for all the apparent self-satisfaction of the comfortable sections of Irish society, we remain deeply neurotic about the process of change that has got us where we are today. We know how much the appearance of a calm, confident, Europeanised society depends on the disappearance through emigration and marginalisation of those who have lost out over the last 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know how much our achievement of a settled and stable nation owes to the movement of some of us to positions on the physical and economic outskirts, out of sight, out of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travellers have the bad grace to remind settled society of what much of it was like before the 1960s and to transgress against the ultimate social etiquette of modern Ireland, the requirement that the poor do not appear except as abstract statistics. That is why a society that supposedly embraces restlessness and the fall of national borders still can't cope with people who will not stay put.  That is why a society that likes to think itself as part of a world in which satellites send images around the world in the blink of an eye is thrown into confusion when a single family moves from Athlone to Moate. We have made ourselves into a place in which anything is acceptable except the truth of our own recent past and how we left it behind.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAST Friday, five minutes before the deadline for objections to the Masonite timber processing plant in Co Leitrim was reached, the Minister for Culture, Mr Higgins, lodged, a formal complaint against the &quot;visual intrusion&quot; of the factory on the river Shannon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It caused all hell to break loose in political and industrial circles as establishment people attempted to assess the importance of the intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives from Masonite Corporation were said to have been staggered when An Bord Pleanala told them a Government Minister had lodged an objection to their planning permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unprecedented for a Government Minister to lodge an objection with An Bord Pleanala against a project approved and supported by a Cabinet colleague. And the fact that the Minister for Forestry, Mr Yates, was only informed after the objection was lodged did nothing to smooth Ministerial feathers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are various explanations offered for Mr Higgins's behaviour apart from his obvious concern to protect the environment. Bruised Fine Gael people suggested there was a degree of last-minute panic involved as the Minister came under intense pressure from key individuals in the heritage and environment lobbies last week. Within the Labour Party, supporters of Mr Higgins saw it as a muscle-flexing exercise, designed to let senior officials at the Office of Public Works know who was boss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public deserved something better, given the high-sounding, undertakings provided in the programme for government. A Cabinet sub-committee is to devise &quot;a new set of indicators of sustainable economic development which will take account of environmental and social factors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Howlin, is preparing a National Sustainable Development Strategy for the Department of the Environment which will &quot;ensure that consideration for the environment is integral to the planning and management of industrial and energy requirements, transport, agriculture and tourism, and our whole pattern of production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is obvious that a major shakeup in the traditional approach to planning is being contemplated. No longer will responsibility for planning lie only with job-starved local authorities, lacking technical expertise and long-term strategies. Mr Higgins's last-minute, muddled intervention may yet represent the beginning of a more structured response to industrial and agricultural developments by a range of Government agencies and Departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few, if any, argue that Mr Higgins was wrong to raise the question of the visual impact the wood-processing plant will have in a prime tourist/high amenity area. Their concerns revolved about the lateness of the objection the impact it might have on foreign investors and the prospect of losing the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explanations offered by the Minister were not compelling.  There was an element of &quot;blame-the-officials&quot; about them, as he spoke of becoming aware of the matter at a very late stage. And, behind the scenes, references were made to unfinished business at the OPW, arising from the battle in the last government between Mr Higgins and Mr Noel Dempsey over Mullaghmore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The powers invoked by the Minister came under the heading of heritage protection and were available for only two months. Even then, there was an element of punch-pulling in his exercise of them.  Rather than address the possible water pollution of the Shannon system, he chose the simpler, &quot;visual impact&quot; issue on which to make his stand. It (would seem that, while bending to (intense pressure from environment and heritage interests, he declined to go the whole hog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing his parliamentary party colleagues last Wednesday, the Minister made it plain he was committed to the provision of jobs in the area. His chief concern was to protect the amenities of the Shannon, he said, and the large-scale investment of Pounds 50 million in tourist related businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY lunch-time yesterday, following a meeting with the Taoiseach, Mr Bruton, and broad-brush criticism from local politicians of all persuasions, the Minister was in full retreat. The matter was later wrapped up in discussions with Masonite officials, which provided for further screening of the plant and a reduction in the height of the structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Higgins was allowed to claim success for his intervention. A balance, as he put it, had been reached with the company &quot;between industrial development and the preservation of Ireland's cherished green environment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr John Ellis of Fianna Fail saw it strictly in terms of a political Uturn. The Sligo/Leitrim deputy argued that if the Minister had shown a little common sense at the start of the week and had investigated the issue comprehensively, an estimated 300 jobs would never have been put at risk. Mr Declan Bree and Mr Gerry Reynolds of the Government parties heaved sighs of relief and went home to reassure their supporters that the promised jobs would materialise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Mr Higgins's limited problem with Masonite has been surmounted, he promised a hands-on approach to future industrial development. &quot;I will continue to defend our heritage while supporting economic development,&quot; he said. &quot;The Shannon has sustained Irish people for thousands of years and we have a duty to protect this asset for future generations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, it would seem that the pendulum is still swinging in favour of industrial job creation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AS THEY become more affluent, people become more and more complacent about what they have. It seems that they begin to think the possession of material things is in itself a virtue, and that the so-called &quot;have-nots&quot; are in some way to blame for their poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as 1989, for example, it was actually a criminal offence (under the Vagrancy Act) to be homeless that certainly put the blame for their destitution on the destitute rather than on a society that was prepared to countenance destitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People may not express the view that there are deserving and undeserving poor quite so crassly as that nowadays, but really this is what underlies the view, which is becoming more and more popular, that social welfare &quot;hand-outs&quot; (the very term is derogatory) create a culture of dependency and &quot;charity&quot; saps people's energies and makes them dependent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course the beauty of that argument, for the purposes of those who perpetrate it, is that there is a grain of truth in it. That just makes it all the more insidious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true people can feel so debased by their poverty and by their need to depend on social welfare payments that they lose all self-respect, and, with it, all will to do any more than exist and survive. They lose the will to live their lives to the full. They lose their enthusiasm, their sense of fun, their ability to celebrate, their talent for joy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it would be a strange response to poverty that said that, for the good of their characters, it would be better to let people die of starvation than to make them dependent on the State or charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, of course, no sensible person would go so far as to say that, but really that is where arguments about the culture of dependency take us, if we follow them to their logical conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I reject the whole notion of a culture of dependency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People don't want to be dependent. It is their lack of access to jobs and a decent living wage that makes them dependent, not some sort of innate tendency to dependency or the fact that there is a minimal safety net provided by social welfare payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody wants to be poor. Nobody wants to be homeless. Not many people would prefer to be on the dole than to earn a decent living in a job that gave them self-respect, a place in the social and economic system, a role in their community and a structure for their daily lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even the strongest proponents of the notion that we live in a dependency culture could argue that it is the availability of unemployment benefit that has driven the unemployment figures up from the levels they were at in the 1970s (less than 60,000 in the early years of that decade) to the levels they are at today (approaching 300,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do not create a culture of dependency by making sure that people have a basic income so they can feed their children and pay their bills. All we are doing is bringing a modicum of social justice into the equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social welfare is not charity it is as far as it goes an attempt to redress the gross injustices in our system, a system that allows some people, not necessarily through any effort of their own, to have enormous wealth, and other people, certainly through no fault of their own, to exist in poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO be poor is to live a daily grind of trying to make ends meet, of juggling rent against food, ESB bills against food, clothes and shoes against food, bus money against food it comes down every time to the difference between being able to put more than bread and jam on the table and meeting all the other pressing costs of living in our modern world where everything costs money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To say that to help a mother of a young family, for example, to meet those costs by providing social welfare payments is creating dependency in her is a fine philosophical point, but it won't pay the bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we are truly concerned about the culture of dependency, we should be exerting every effort to make sure people have jobs so that they can be independent rather than bemoaning the fact of their dependency. I can remember the outrage expressed in the early 1970s at the numbers who were unemployed in Ireland (in the high 50,000s to mid-60,000s, with a high of over 70,000 in March 1970) and the determination that this number would have to be reduced to zero. And look how far we've got not far short of 300,000 on the dole and, just to keep the figures at that level, the necessity to create 25,000 new jobs (without losing any) every year (NESC report, November 1993).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a situation like this we absolutely must give priority to job creation and to finding new ways of letting people work and make a contribution to their communities. Blaming the victims of unemployment and poverty is not going to help in the this endeavour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I WOULD like to turn this culture of dependency notion on its head and point out that of course people are dependent everyone is. Even the most successful business people are dependent on consumers to buy their products - otherwise there would not be any businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we are all, or nearly all of us, dependent to some extent on the State. The State spends enormous amounts every year on all sorts of services, from health and education to transport and the promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination. All that money benefits most of us in one way or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course the money comes from us too, in the form of taxes, but many, many more of us are net beneficiaries than might care to admit it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, some people are driven by circumstance into a more acute form of dependency, but I would argue that our system as it exists creates dependencies in people not by redressing social injustice and making sure that people, whether they are employed or not, have an income, but by failing to find creative ways to allow people to make a contribution to their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as people are forced to sign on because there is no work for them, so long will we have a dependent population. It is not provision that makes people dependent it is lack of provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE future of the troubled computer group Reflex will be considered by sharehold at a special meeting on July 10th because last year's losses wiped out its shareholders' funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting has been called because the group's assets exceeded its liabilities by only Pounds 154,000 at the end of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting pre tax losses of Pounds 5.8 million for the year, Reflex revealed yesterday that shareholders' funds have fallen to just Pounds 154,000 from Pounds 1.8 million at the end of 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive chairman, Mr Tony Kilduff, described the 1994 outcome - a loss of 22.56p per share - as &quot;disgraceful&quot;. He said that 1994 was a very difficult year for the company and the expensive campaign to develop its Irish software business was ultimately unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he insisted that Reflex is now profitable, following a reorganisation which has reduced the group to three companies in Britain and a &quot;small head office in Dublin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the operations two computer rental companies and a software company - are trading profitably in the current hall, he said. The Pounds 300,000 raised from the sale of Reflex Maintenance which was completed on May 10th is not included in the 1994 results, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest result follow a profit warning from the company in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At less than half the group's nominal share capital of Pounds 1.45 million, shareholders funds are now at a level which requires the holding of an extraordinary general meeting under company law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pounds 3 million rights issue in March 1994 had raised shareholders funds to Pounds 3.2 million at the half way stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1994 result follows a profit of Pounds 0.6 million for the previous year and earnings per share of 3.73p. It includes losses of Pounds 2.9 million on discontinued operations and a loss of Pounds 1.8 million on the disposal of its main Irish software company, AutoComputing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But continuing operations recorded a loss of Pounds 0.9 million compared with a profit of Pounds 1 million for the preceding year, despite an increase in turnover from Pounds 5.4 million to Pounds 5.7 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kilduff said the loss on continuing operations reflected the inclusion for the period of Reflex Maintenance which &quot;accounted for virtually all of the loss&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With overall sales down from Pounds 8.1 million to Pounds 6.5 million he admitted that sales targets were not achieved in the Irish software business, Auto Computing, which was sold to its management in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jump in operation expenses from Pounds 3.5 million to Pounds 6.8 million reflected &quot;exceptional costs and extra costs in the software business to sort out problems&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating losses jumped to Pounds 3.9 million, compared with a profit of Pounds 0.6 million. A lower interest bill, down from Pounds 0.3 million to Pounds 0.07 million following the rights issue last March which raised Pounds 3 million to pay down debt, helped the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well ahead of the first half loss of 1.2 million, the latest result follows a period of review and restructuring at Reflex. The share price closed 1p lower at 7p yesterday, well off its 1991 high of 127p and its high so far this year of 20p.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton and Japanese prime minister Mr Tomiichi Murayama met at the start of the G7 summit in Halifax yesterday but made no apparent progress in staving off a looming US Japan trade war which, if not contained could plunge the global economy into recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact trade relations the two economic powers soured further last night when the Japanese trade minister Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto refused to attend a dinner with three other trade ministers because one was the US trade negotiator, Mr Mky Kantor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is to impose 100 per cent tariffs amounting to six billion dollars on Japanese luxury car imports by June 28th, unless agreement is reached to, open Japan's car and car parts markets. Japan has threatened immediate retalliation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a joint news conference after an hour of talks ahead of the opening of the summit, both the US and Japanese leaders stressed they wanted an agreement but their tone was uncompromising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is important,&quot; said the Japanese premier, standing beside Mr Clinton, &quot;is that we do not engage in talks with both of our fists raised, but rather talk to each other in good faith.&quot; He said he had asked Mr Clinton to lift the deadline. &quot;I did not and will not agree to extend the deadline,&quot; an unsmiling US President said. &quot;I have instructed our negotiators to pursue every possible avenue of resolution before the June 28th deadline and I remain hopeful that an acceptable, meaningful agreement can be reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if a solution cannot be found by the deadline, I will impose sanctions and the United States will also pursue a case before the World Trade Organisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Murayama said &quot;If the June 28 sanctions are put into effect, Japan will not recognise them as valid.&quot; The US action would violate international trade accords. But he thought there was still room for compromise through continued negotiations. Trade officials for both sides are scheduled to meet next week in Geneva to try to beat the June 28 deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such trade disputes should not sour broader U.S. Japan relations,&quot; Murayama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US is also pressing for permission for Federal Express to expand to Japan. At present Federal Express planes are refused permission to land in Tokyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clinton, coming to Halifax after one of the major gambles of his presidency - the announcement of a ten year White House plan to balance the US budget struck an unexpectedly optimistic note before leaving Washington for the G7 summit, which brings together the leaders of the US, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe we can reach a successful conclusion and I intend to do everything to see that it is done,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Murayama has much to lose in the brinkmanship with the US. The sanctions could gravely affect Japan's shaky economic recovery, already threatened by the dollar's sharp plunge against the yen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clinton said he was seeking to pursue with the other G7 leaders ways to &quot;prevent financial problems from exploding into crises as they did in Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE LAST couple of weeks have seen economists everywhere rush to revise down their forecasts of worlds and European growth, based largely on a reassessment of the strength of the US economy. After almost five years of steady expansion, the US appears to be finally running out of steam, with the engine of job creation beginning to splutter, while corporate America is feeling the strain of progressively rising interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US is still the global locomotive, and slowing growth over there, combined with the negative effects of a chronically weak dollar on European exports, is causing a sharp downward revision in forecasts on this side of the Atlantic. Economists are coming up with all kinds of models to describe the next phase of the economic cyde; predictions will vary between &quot;hard landings, soft landings, growth recessions to try to explain what happens next. In the midst of all this revisionism, the forecasts for Ireland, backed up by survey data, remain remarkably buoyant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic surveys provide useful material for forecasters. Instead of trying to find some tenuous, and sometimes not so convincing, relationship between interest rates and domestic demand, the simple response from survey data can sometimes prove more incisive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year, one survey, the Pan European economic survey, has been an extremely accurate leading indicator of EU economic performance. Every month the EU Commission in Brussels compile the results of an in depth survey across 12 states, giving a snapshot of the mood of business and consumers. Since February, this barometer has been suggesting that the strong recovery experienced last year may well be stalling a little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, consumers and producers have become considerably less upbeat about the future. In the case of producers, the more sombre assessment appears to stem from a fear that when the export kick of 1994 wanes, domestic demand will not be sufficiently robust to take up the running. Relatedly, the domestic consumer - the key player in generating home demand - is still overshadowed by job insecurity, stagnant real wages and, in some countries, lingering concerns about higher taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is one state which bucks the downbeat trend. So conspicuous is the strength of Irish confidence overall that in almost all areas it is well above the average. Bear in mind, that these survey responses have been extremely reliable in forecasting future trends in the economy, both in Ireland and throughout the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industrial production here continued to expand while it fell Europe wide. Order books continued to swell with export orders particularly impressive. Irish firms now have orders sufficient to guarantee nearly three months worth of production, and significantly when employment expectations were retrenching nearly everywhere, our own manufacturers suggest that they intend to employ more people in the months ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally nowhere, did we deviate from the trend more noticeably than in the construction sector. Whereas in recent months construction confidence almost everywhere has fallen back sharply, in Ireland it has surged. Likewise, the employment outlook continued to improve in this labour intensive sector. Not surprisingly, in a month when housing price expectations fell all over Europe, price expectations in the Irish housing sector accelerated to within a point of their all time highs, recorded at the peak of the 1980s housing price boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, the picture is one of an economy dramatically bucking the trend. Whereas growth forecasts are tumbling almost everywhere, all evidence in Ireland points to a more dramatic expansion in the period ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as significantly, &quot;the man on the street&quot; - and many business people - appear to reinforce the upbeat view which Irish&nbsp;economists have been spouting for quite a while. Will it all come unstuck as in the early 1990s when 8.6 per cent growth collapsed to 2.9 per cent in 1991? It doesn't seem likely - for the moment it &quot;feels good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE rate of inflation has risen to 2.8 per cent, indicating pressure on prices due to strong economic growth. The mid May figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) show that the rate rose from 2.5 per cent in the previous quarter, an increase at the higher end of expectations in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures show a 1.1 per cent increase in prices during the three months to mid May, compared to 0.8 per cent during the previous quarter. The CSO will not publish the breakdown of the figures until this evening, but last night market analysts speculated that rising prices had resulted from the strength of the economy, increasing mortgage interest rates and rising import prices resulting in the weakness of the pound against Continental EU currencies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Padraic Garvey, economist with Riada stockbrokers, said that he was sticking with his forecast that the overall average rate of inflation for the year will be 3 per cent. The Riada forecast is above most other market estimates and higher than the Department of Finance (2.5 per cent) and the Central Bank (2.5 - 2.6 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Garvey said that the increase in mortgage interest rates in the quarter was one factor contributing to higher prices. Importers may also be passing on higher Irish pound prices they are paying for purchases in countries like Germany, due to the weakness of the Irish currency against the deutschmark bloc. Also, producer price figures had been indicating inflationary pressures at the wholesale level for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Goodbody stockbrokers, economist Mr Han de Jong said the midMay figures were at the &quot;higher end of expectations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Central Bank credit figures continue to show strong growth and the next quarterly inflation data shows another rise &quot;then an interest rate hike will be inevitable, regardless of monetary policy moves elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riada is expecting one further increase in interest rates later in the year, although Mr Garvey believes that the latest figures have no immediate implications for borrowing costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking out over the rest of the year, Mr de Jong said that the strong domestic economy, price rises in construction and rising manufacturing output prices could all maintain pressure on prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, stable interest rates for the moment and the positive impact of the pound's rise against sterling would act to restrain inflation. He is forecasting an average rate for the year of 2.7 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish inflation rate continues to compare well internationally, although many of the lower inflation EU states have rates around 1.6 to 2.4 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK figures published yesterday showed inflation running at per cent. However the underlying inflation rate in the UK - excluding mortgage interest - and the similar figure for Ireland are both at around 2.7 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodbody stockbrokers calculate that excluding mortgage costs, the underlying Irish rate at 2.7 per cent in mid May was unchanged from the mid February figure. They believe that a rise in food prices evident in the first quarter continued in the latest quarter, while a rise in alcohol prices and petrol costs also contributed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BRITISH retail price inflation edged up last month, fuelling City doubts about the ability of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to achieve his inflation target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that underlying inflation - which excludes mortgage interest payments - rose to a seasonally adjusted 2.7 per cent in May, from 2.6 per cent in April.  Headline inflation, which includes all items, rose from 3.3 per cent to 3.4 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this level is low by historical standards, it is the fifth consecutive month that price growth has been outside the Government's target of bringing underlying inflation below 2.5 per cent by the end of the current parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clarke said on Wednesday he would extend this 2.5 per cent target beyond that time - albeit with a secondary upper limit of 4 per cent if unexpected price shocks occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His announcement was yesterday viewed with some scepticism in the City, amid fears that he might use the broader target to avoid politically unpopular base rate rises. Mr Clarke repeated that he remained committed to the 2.5 per cent target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, yesterday's figures showed that manufacturing price pressures are increasingly feeding through to shops. Non seasonal food prices showed the largest monthly rise in May for 13 years a hint that last year's supermarket price wars may be easing. Household goods prices also showed their sharpest monthly rise for four years.  Leisure goods prices fell, but most other sectors rose. Consequently, &quot;core&quot; price inflation, which excludes tax and housing costs, rose to 2.2 per cent in May - its highest level for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at brokers James Capel, said: &quot;Retailers are now less prepared to slash prices to gain volume. This is a very worrying development - inflation pressures further back in the supply chain are already intense and the chances of this spilling over into retail prices are increasing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer spending, however, remains relatively muted. Although the volume of retail sales in May was 0.2 per cent higher than in April, it was a mere 1.1 per cent higher than the same period a year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Michael Saunder, economist at Salomon Brothers, said: &quot;We had previously expected further base rate hikes in the coming month to push inflation back below 2.5 per cent. However, the chancellor's apparently relaxed approach to an overshoot of the target casts doubt on whether this will happen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE US dollar has benefited from a round of buying coinciding with the start of the Group of Seven summit in Halifax while in Dublin the pound lost 1.5 cents against the rising US currency to end in after hours trading at $ 1.6225. The European Commission president, Mr Jacques Santer, has said he will ask the summit to consider measures to stabilise the US currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dollar jumped above DM 1.41 marks in late European trading while moving cautiously towards 85 yen, with dealers also citing chart based factors for its firmness. Yet traders said there was little conviction or direction behind trading, which was dampened by the absence of German markets for the Corpus Christi holiday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dollar has traded mostly in a range between DM 1.3930 and DM 1.4250 marks for the past 16 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock market investors were happy to see a firmer dollar, which helps European exporters, and the London FTSE-100 gained 0.92 per cent, adding 30.6 points to 3,370.4, with the French market also rising strongly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dollar was aided by the background factor of the Halifax G7 meeting and restrained hopes that an end might be in sight to the damaging US Japan car trade dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said the G7 meeting is unlikely to end with more than an expression of its usual desire for more orderly markets and a closer look at fundamentals. A communique is due on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of central bank intervention helped the dollar recoup losses in Tokyo overnight and the fear of coordinated action to support the dollar was still a market factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US weekly jobless claims, industrial production and capacity utilisation data for May disappointed the New York bond market since they showed stronger than expected economy and hence reduced prospects for an interest rate cut. But analysts said the data supported a soft landing thesis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the European Institute in Washington, Mr Santer said a single European currency would benefit the US by providing the basis for a more stable international monetary system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not an overt challenge to the mighty greenback but a response to the fact that the oscillations of the US dollar in the last 15 years have not helped world, economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A currency see saw, a yo yo - how does that help our mutual trade and investment flows? I believe we must work together towards a more manageable international monetary system in the medium term for everyone's benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe the type of surveillance/convergence criteria we are adopting to get our economies in shape in the European Union have some important lessons for the type of reforms that could be transposed internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Santer's call was backed by the European employers federation, UNICE.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESS THIS WEEK; OPINION; Pg. Supplement page 3</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1128 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THREE weeks after the announcement of the Aer Lingus results for the 21 months ended December, and a week after the belated publication of its Annual Report and Accounts, this document was not available in Aer Lingus public offices or in Government Publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having tried both of these sources without success, I finally succeeded in obtaining a copy by contacting the Office of the Chief Executive at Dublin Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I received the Report I found it almost totally lacking in any information on the performance of our national airline. The Report is effectively confined to purely financial data about the Aer Lingus Group as a whole. The only other information provided is a simple sub-division of the Group's financial turnover and employment as between Passenger and Cargo Services, Airline Services, Hotels and Commercial Investments, and a couple of percentage increase figures for Transatlantic traffic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All other information provided in earlier Aer Lingus Reports has disappeared. Information such as:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Breakdown of profit/loss between the four divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Punctuality data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Details of fleet including ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Operating Revenue by geographical source and for European and transatlantic services separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of all these data led me to conclude that a separate document containing this information might have been published in addition to this purely financial report. However when I approached the Chief Executive's Office on this point I was told that none of this information was being made available. The Board had decided that this material must be omitted as it was commercially sensitive and could assist competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Subsequently I received some data additional to what is contained in the Report. But this merely distinguished the company's profit on air transport from losses incurred on other activities and provided a breakdown of this profit data between two sub-periods covered by the Report).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked for some indication of just how a competitor could gain an advantage by seeing any or all of the omitted figures, but I could secure no answer on this point. I was simply told that none of this information could be made available to me, to the public or to the Dail. If I wished, I could be given a &quot;briefing&quot; which, however, would include none of this information. I declined this offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I pointed out that monthly airline traffic data is published regularly, e.g. in &quot;Airline Business&quot;, I was told that nevertheless even annual Aer Lingus traffic totals were now on the secret list so far as the Irish public are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This traffic information, broken down between scheduled and.  charters, international and domestic as well as figures for the proportion of space sold (load factors), aircraft utilisation and breakdown of staff numbers is in fact made available by Aer Lingus on a monthly basis to the International Air Transport Association. IATA provides this information to airline trade journals - which, Aer Lingus's feared competitors can buy, but which are not readily accessible to the Irish public or to the Dail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is it clear what advantage, in terms of commercial decisions they might take, could be gained by Aer Lingus competitors from the rest of the information hitherto published but now suppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a concerned observer and, through the State, an ultimate shareholder in the Group of which our national airline is part, I find this decision of the Board both incomprehensible and unacceptable, and I hope that the Dail through its Committee on Commercial State Bodies will share my concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For without the information previously published but now withheld, the Oireachtas and the public could be left completely unaware of a future Aer Lingus crisis until it was too late to do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me illustrate this point by reference to what in fact happened to Aer Lingus in 1990/91.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that year the Aer Lingus Group reported a profit before tax and excluding extraordinary items amounting to over Pounds 6 million. If the company's Report for that year had been published in the secretive format that has now been adopted, we could not have known that the airline had incurred an operating loss of over Pounds 27 million on its European operations in that year - viz. a loss of 9 per cent on turnover, before allowing for interest payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor could we have known that an important factor in this result was an increase of no less than one-sixth in the European routes' cost level by comparison with the previous year. We would also have been unaware of the fact that an attempt had been made to cover this cost deterioration by sharply reversing the decline in fare levels which had been taking place in the two previous years. And we could not have known that this 12 per cent fare increase, coinciding with the onset of the post-German re-unification recession had contributed to a reduction in the company's European traffic growth rate from 25 per cent a year to as little as 5 per cent as well as to a drop in the share of traffic moving by air as against sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these danger signs would have been hidden from the Dail and the public if the information then published had been suppressed in accordance with the practice now adopted by the Aer Lingus Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, after the disaster that struck Aer Lingus in the years that followed, we can be sure that a much more alert public opinion today would not permit a repetition of the failure to deal with a future crisis in the airline if the emergence of such a crisis were known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unhappily the suppression of all the relevant information on the airline's performance, in the dubious name of commercial secrecy, is likely to prevent such a development becoming known until it might be too late to save the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only real safeguard is the availability to Dail and public of a certain minimum volume of information on the performance of the airline. A Government committed to the introduction of Freedom of Information legislation could make a useful start now by requiring the Board of Aer Lingus to provide this necessary minimum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to withhold important information takes away from the credit the company certainly deserves for turning an air transport loss of Pounds 38 million into a profit of Pounds 79 million for the nine months ended December last a figure which, however, will not have been maintained for the full 12-month period because the seasonal dip in traffic in the January-March period. Unfortunately it is impossible to assess how much of this recovery reflects a reduction in the company's cost level. It's a pity the company did not feel able to disclose just how much it has achieved in this respect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CHINA turned up the heat yesterday in an anti-US campaign, focusing on a US decision in May to reduce quotas on Chinese textile imports to criticise Washington and warn of retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a lengthy and highly detailed dispatch, Xinhua quoted a senior Ministry of Foreign Trade Economic Co-operation official as accusing the United States of basing its &quot;unilateral&quot; decision on faulty and partial evidence and of breaking bilateral agreements with China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China believes that the US has adopted an irresponsible attitude which has brought trouble to Sino-US economic and trade relations,&quot; he said, referring to Washington's May decision to cut China's textile import quota by 1.83 million dozen garments because of alleged illegal transhipments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the US persists in sticking to its incorrect position of unilateral quota charge backs, it will be very difficult for the Chinese government to maintain co-operation with the US.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE life assurance industry is facing monumental changes, partly as a result of its own excesses and partly because of the low inflation, low return economic climate. But should the Irish life assurance industry be regulated by statutory controls as it is in Britain, or is the Irish system of evolving self regulation the better way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seminar held earlier this month by the Society of Actuaries in Ireland addressed these issues and revealed some shocking statistics about the cost and impact of regulation in Britain. Many of the 150 delegates who attended included senior executives of some of the biggest Irish insurance companies and while they may have been relieved that statutory regulation has so far been avoided here, they were also presented with the picture of a gloomy future for their companies if considerable reform of life products - especially their costs and means of distribution - is not undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Ireland, disclosure of commission remuneration, among other features, and the impact of charges on surrender values, has already been introduced on a voluntary basis, and according to the IIF, at a relatively modest cost. Speakers at the seminar revealed that the cost of introducing disclosure regulations in Britain will amount to a staggering Pounds 250 million sterling; the regulators' original estimate was just Pounds 100 million plus another Pounds 50 million a year in on going costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Maynard, head of research with Mercantile &amp; General told the seminar that life offices and independent financial advisers M &amp; G surveyed last March not only reported that compliance costs were higher than expected, but blamed the new regulations for the fact that their sales for the first quarter of 1995 were down on average between 10 and 30 per cent on the same period last year. Some companies reported drops in sales of 50-60 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The new regulations require that companies disclose the cost of commission and other charges, the impact of charges on surrender values for the entire term of the contract and other pertinent information).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually all the life offices are reporting that sales interviews are taking longer and more interviews are necessary before a sale is secured, said Mr Maynard. Yet the same number of salespeople are involved. The result is &quot;a reduction in salesforce effectiveness and a consequent increase in costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disclosure has had little effect on the value of remuneration to sales intermediaries, according to the M &amp; G survey, though a number of companies have introduced more flexible commission options, even going so far as to rebate the commission to the client in the form of cash or higher allocation to the investment fund. &quot;There is a trend towards fee based earnings, but it is very slow,&quot; says Mr Maynard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor has the disclosure regulations had a huge impact on the kinds of products available, though there has been some re pricing of products and some companies have withdrawn some products - &quot;mainly investment plans, endowment mortgages and some term assurances.&quot; Interestingly, most independent intermediaries presumably brokers and IFAs (Independent Financial Advisers) who were surveyed &quot;cited some confusion for the client and an extra administrative burden&quot; as a result of the disclosure rules, but overall were not unhappy since the PIA 'key features' document provided - &quot;clear explanations, free from jargon, helpful charts and tables and a professional image&quot;.  Consumers, it seems are fairly indifferent to the new disclosure regulations, but are very concerned about all the scandals that have emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her address to the seminar, Collette Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority, (PIA) has been given the job of introducing and regulating the new disclosure regime, admitted that regulation of the industry since the Financial Services Act was introduced in 1988 has been too complicated and costly. The PIA, she said, epitomised the &quot;second wave of regulation&quot; and its job was partly to simplify the statutory codes in order to make sure consumers had sufficient information to make an intelligent choice about the products it needed. It was not the job of the PIA to take the risk out of investment or to come between the customer and the company, said Ms Bowe. Where a company has clearly abused its position in the marketplace, the PIA has not hesitated in censuring and finding offenders while also insisting that better training or working practices be introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers of complaints Family Money has received about life assurance products - the way they have been sold, the promises readers believed were made by salesmen, the disappointing investment returns are significant. Many more such complaints have found their way to insurance companies, the IIF, the brokers association, government departments, the Insurance Ombudsman (whose brief from the IIF prevents her from investigating many complaints), the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and other newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two speakers at the Actuaries Seminar addressed the issue of consumer confidence both in Britain and here. Chris Johnson, an industry consultant with Tillinghast, and Calm Fagan, a former executive with Lifetime and now with consultant Life Strategies, focused on the need for a simplification of life assurance products, more flexible, innovative products to suit changing lifestyles and earning patterns, and a serious reduction in costs. All of these improvements would eventually lead to consumer trust and confidence in the industry, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr Johnson, &quot;in the interests of shorter term advantage, we've concentrated far too much on the intermediary and nothing like enough on the ultimate client.&quot; As a natural consequence, he said, &quot;we have allowed the costs of distribution to become greater than the value distribution adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's worth reflecting that when you buy from BMW or Mercedes, or from Sony or Toshiba, you don't worry too much about the intermediary. You have confidence in the company and its standards.  No financial services organisation in Britain has yet drawn anywhere near such brand awareness and trust, but why should it not be possible,&quot; said MT Johnston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sees the industry dividing into two businesses - one, a commodity based service which can cheaply and efficiently supply relatively - simple products like term assurance, unit trusts, single premium bonds and short term savings products. The other side of the business will be the advice driven products needed for more complex instruments such as long term savings and pensions. Businesses which go this route will also have to take a more innovative approach to distribution, including greater use of information technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most perceptive comments came from Colm Fagan of Life Strategies, a company which advises the industry, who said &quot;Transparent products need less regulation. The simple fact is that if product designs were totally transparent, there would be less need for regulations on the content of sales illustrations, the competence of salespeople and commission rates to intermediaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The huge cost of regulation in Britain has clearly shaken the industry there and will certainly support the widely held industry and Department view that self regulation is more appropriate for the smaller Irish insurance market. Greater disclosure of information has been introduced in recent years but the industry has further to go in terms of addressing its high costs and in the problem of self policing. Widening the powers of the Insurance Ombudsman to include the investigation of poor perceived value and alleged misselling by intermediaries would probably go some way to improving credibility and trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DUBLIN had a mixed day with the market falling overall despite a strong performance in London and a good opening in New York. The Dow's record closing on Wednesday and the benign inflation figures in Britain pushed London ahead, but Dublin failed to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However prices in Dublin were generally firm, particularly AIB and CRH. AIB was 1p better on 297p and looks set to test the 300p level.  CRH broke through the 400p barrier to close 401p, a rise of 1 1/2p.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smurfit was a disappointment, falling 3 1/2p to 168p, with sectoral weakness in the US given as the reason. US paper shipments for May showed a surprise fall of 2.7 per cent, against an increase of 2 per cent that had been forecast by the large companies. Stone Container and International Paper, both peers of Smurfit's US associate JSC Corp, now face possible downgradings, which will further weaken the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a smattering of smaller company news. Reflex posted pre-tax loses of Pounds 5.6 million, compared to profits of Pounds 868,000 last time. The losses had been expected after the very difficult year Reflex experienced, but the shares shed another lp to close at 7p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petroceltic issued a bullish statement to the effect that the new deal struck by Bord Gais and Marathon over gas supplies from the Celtic Sea was good for it also. The company's shares moved ahead 3p to 25p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish Permanent seems to have stabilised at 310p after its recent falls. Turnover figures show that a steady Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 700,000 worth of shares have traded each day this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greencore continues to hold steady at its record high of 450p and Irish Continental Group's good run also continues, with the shares flat at 445p. Kerry slipped back 2p to 398p while Waterford Foods fell 5p to 84p.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FT-SE 100 Index closed 30.6 higher at 3,370.4, just 10.4 short of its 1995 high set earlier this month. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index failed to match the performance of the FT-SE 100, ending 8.2 firmer at 3,662.1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 250 index was burdened by poor performances from a number of retailing stocks, hit by poor results from Allders, as well as widespread weakness in many of the housebuilders and regional electricity stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast the underperformers in the 100 index, Sears, the retailing group, and Southern and Eastern Electricity, were only marginally easier on the session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirmation that Kleinwort Benson and Dresdner Bank were involved in bid talks triggered an early frisson of excitement in the market.  But the realisation that any bid would come in around Kleinwort's closing price on Wednesday - 724p - and not at a substantial premium, plus initial disappointment with May's inflation numbers, saw the market lose its early impetus and drift back to negative territory.  The market took some comfort from the smaller than expected increase in May retail sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vodafone was the target of renewed and heavy US buying, with the shares climbing to another all-time high.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A MUCH rumoured bid for British investment bank Kleinwort Benson emerged yesterday in the shape of a Pounds 970 million offer from Germany's Dresdner Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the bid succeeds, and analysts think it will, Kleinwort Benson will follow a string of other traditional British banking name into foreign ownership and leave only smaller independent investment banks in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the bid say the price will not change, although initially some analysts had speculated that the final offer would top Pounds 1 billion. The sources said the price was not forming part of the continuing talks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An announcement from Dresdner and Kleinwort said the firms were in talks on &quot;the possibility of a recommended cash offer for Kleinwort Benson at around its current market price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said: &quot;They would not have said that if they were going to deviate from that price level. Now they are just dotting the Is and crossing the Ts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kleinwort shares closed at 724p on Wednesday, valuing the group at around Pounds 970 million sterling. They closed five pence lower at 719p yesterday, having touched a low of 710p earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks declined to comment further on the talks and reaction in German markets, where it was a holiday, was limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the two sides were discussing the details of the bid, including regulatory approvals. They expected a further announcement in about 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts spent the day evaluating the situation and were concluding that the Dresdner bid could succeed at around the market level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They noted the big jump in Kleinwort's share price since last week. On June 7th the shares closed at 663p, 61p lower than Wednesday's close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they'd announced the bid then, 724p per share would have looked a lot nicer,&quot; said one analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The indication that talks centre on around 720p a share must have disappointed some bullish people,&quot; said merchant banking analyst Martin Cross at UBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is a sensible figure for discussion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment bank Morgan Grenfell fell to Dresdner's rival Deutsche Bank in late 1989, and recently the pace of acquisitions in the sector has speeded up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, Swiss Bank Corp agreed an Pounds 860 million takeover of SG Warburg, the biggest British investment bank. Blue blooded Barings was saved after huge losses, but surrendered its independence, when Dutch bank Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING) stepped in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts do not expect other bids for Kleinwort to emerge, although the possibility could pressure the talks to a timely conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts expect any deal to be agreed sooner rather than later to rule out the uncertainty which proved so damaging to Warburg, staff morale before the SBC deal was clinched.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--(London Independent Service)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESS THIS WEEK; US ECONOMY; Pg. Supplement Page 7</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN PUTTING forward his own plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton has taken a hugely risky step - one that could give him the initiative in the dominating political issue of the hour, or prove a blunder that alienates key supporters and drives the final nail into his hopes of retaining the White House next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nub of Mr Clinton's proposals, sketched out in a five minute Oval Office speech on Tuesday evening (which the big networks this time deigned to broadcast live), was as expected smaller cuts in federal health care programmes than proposed by the Republicans, coupled with scaled down tax reductions, and a balanced budget by 2005, compared with the more ambitious target of 2002 set by the Republican plans approved by the House and Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall his package envisages $ 1.2 trillion of cuts over 10 years, slightly more than the Senate but rather less than the House, which must also offset $ 350 billion of tax cuts prescribed in Speaker Newt Gingrich's 'Contract with America.' But far more important than the figures were the politics. And the initial fall out has been mixed at best.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of discussion among his divided aides, the advice which ultimately prevailed was that Mr Clinton could no longer simply sit out the Republican driven debate, hoping to capitalise on public disenchantment once the scale of the cuts became apparent and relying on his ability to veto the final package this autumn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the President has put down a marker, and perhaps prepared the ground for a deal with Congress. This in turn would avert what Speaker Newt Gingrich calls the &quot;train wreck scenario&quot; of a Republican budget rejected by the White House, leading to a standoff that would virtually shut down the federal government when the new fiscal year begins in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows better than Mr Clinton what happened when a similar deadlock arose in 1990. Then the roles were reversed, and a Republican President was obliged to go back on previous pledges and agree tax increases demanded by a Democratic Congress, in order to pass a budget for fiscal 1991. That about face, which infuriated the Republican right, is widely believed to have cost George Bush the 1992 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By making his first bargaining bid far earlier in the cycle, Mr Clinton seeks to have a say in how events unfold, and reduce the risk of such confrontation. But as with Mr Bush, the cost could be high as a corresponding rebellion in Democratic ranks was already suggesting yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the Tuesday broadcast, Tom Daschle and Richard Gephardt, the Democratic leaders in Senate and House respectively, vainly urged him to stay out of the fray, arguing that their strategy of accusing the Republicans of slashing benefits for the poor to pay for massive tax breaks for the rich was starting to pay dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now however, by announcing his own balanced budget plan, Mr Clinton has given the Republicans cover - to the point of acknowledging it was possible to achieve the feat in seven rather than 10 years but that &quot;the pain we would inflict on our elderly, our students and our economy just isn't worth it. &quot;The Republican response was warily favourable: &quot;He's running to catch up but let's welcome him aboard,&quot; said House Majority leader Dick Armey of Texas.  But among traditional Democratic interest groups and liberals on Capitol Hill the response was furious. As Democratic Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin witheringly spoke in a formal statement of the comfort proved by past experience that, &quot;If you don't like the President's position on a particular issue, you simply need to wait a few weeks.&quot; Moderates were more sympathetic however, noting like Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey that &quot;You can't fight something with nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MORE than two years after it was created, Union's internal market is working well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the EU seems to be dragging its feet on enforcing key rules on public procurement, taxation and movement of people, the European Commission said in its second annual report on the single market adopted yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The analysis of the state of the single market . . . shows that much remains to be done to make the single market a genuine frontier free area in which the free movement of people, goods, services and capital is a tangible reality,&quot; Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation was particularly disappointing regarding the abolition of border controls on people living in the 15 nation bloc which to a large extent has remained a dead letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the progress made by a group of seven EU countries, which agreed to eliminate passport controls between them in the so called Schengen accord, was brought into question this week when France questioned whether the deal was irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accord came into force in March in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European businesses were also likely to have to wait for the benefits of the single market to materialise in some areas the Commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was particularly true of draft legislation in the field of company taxation - such as a proposal to avoid double taxation of interest and royalty payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem here is that decisions on taxation issues can only be taken unanimously by EU ministers and some countries, notably Britain, are reluctant to do away with this rule when the EU's institutions and decision making rules come under review next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even when EU legislation had become law, there was a lack of willingness in implementing it at national level, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken as a whole, the 12 states that composed the Union at the end of 1994 - Finland, Sweden and Austria joined in January had adopted 89.9 per cent of internal legislation. Denmark performed particularly well with 96.3 per cent rate while Greece was the last in the league table with 80.4 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some sectors, however, the situation was worrying. Only 51 per cent of public procurement legislation had been applied correctly, according to the report, and delays were also noticeable in the intellectual property and insurance areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BIRDS twittered softly on the trees and a river gurgled softly over rocks as a heron stood in the mudflats near a cluster of ivy-draped cottages in the quiet pastoral setting of, er, the Department of Education offices in Marlborough Street, Dublin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging by the content of this year's &quot;Imaginative Composition Still Life&quot; art papers, distributed to schools yesterday to enable students to prepare for next week's exam, the Department's examiners are living a rural idyll admirably untarnished by the realities of life in the late 20th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The higher-level paper oozes healthy country living to such a degree that hay fever sufferers should probably skip the rest of this paragraph altogether. &quot;The bridge leads to a cluster of ivy draped cottages of a folk village,&quot; the higher-level paper warbles happily.  &quot;Doors and windows are festooned with climbing roses. Tall hollyhocks and sunflowers were there in abundance together with fuchsia and poppies.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's absolutely appalling,&quot; one aggrieved Tipperary art teacher grimaced. &quot;Whoever thought it up is positively antediluvian.&quot; And it gets worse, as ploughmen guide horses through brown steaming earth, pigs squeal as buckets of swill are tossed in their trough and a swarthy blacksmith beats horse shoes in the village forge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kid in the 1990s knows what a bloody forge looks like?&quot; cried our teacher, not unreasonably. &quot;It's extremely out of date and very trying for any kid of the '90s. There's nothing in it to stimulate them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper's only concession to the advent of modern life is a &quot;liveried chauffeur polishing one of the gleaming limousines&quot; lined up before a luxury hotel, a scenario with which most Leaving Certificate students are unlikely to be overly familiar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinary-level students fare slightly beller, since their paper does at least feature a town, though the examiners are unable to resist going for a wander outside its boundaries to smell the &quot;ferns and small flowers&quot;, paddle in the mudflats and share a meal of rich aftergrass with some passing cows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, no one in the Department of Education was available to comment when we called, the call of the wild possibly being too strong to resist in the rural environs of Dublin 1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, the industry's self-regulating body, also reaffirmed its basic principle that advertisements should be legal, decent, honest and truthful, as well as made with a sense of responsibility to society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Code of Advertising Standards, published yesterday says in its rule on sexism and stereotyping that advertisements should reflect the fact that men and women perform and share household management and domestic tasks. The stipulation could put an end to the era of publicity for washing and cleaning products which portrays women undertaking all the chores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same rule insists that both men and women take major purchasing decisions' in the workplace and at home, and that advertisements should reflect this reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules about alcohol have been tightened up to require that anyone in a drink advertisement should appear to be over 25 previously this clause applied only to those seen consuming alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, specific rules have been introduced to deal with the wave of advertisers making environmental claims.  Manufacturers must now substantiate such claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Northern Secretary yesterday reaffirmed the British government's undeviating demand for movement on the issue of paramilitary weapons when he said there must be a tangible demonstration that IRA arms will be decommissioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Armagh, Sir Patrick Mayhew said people did not understand why, if paramilitaries were serious about peace, they had to keep their weapons. He said the gesture required &quot;would have to amount to substantial progress. It would have to be enough to signify the start of a process and to signify that there is good faith in the words that say peace is here for keeps.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate comment on the issue yesterday, the North's Security Minister, Sir John Wheeler, said he was prepared to devise legal means to assist the process of decommissioning. People wanted to see evidence that violence was over for good. &quot;The evidence that it is ended for good comes from the action of the terrorist gangs themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They possess the explosives and the weaponry. They must get rid of the explosives and the weaponry, and I will help them in that process. I will devise legal mechanisms, if need be, to assist them to get rid of these unwanted weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir John Wheeler said the handing in of arms did not have to take place in the United Kingdom it could take place in the Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in an article in yesterday's Irish Times, Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams said that even a symbolic gesture of decommissioning arms would &quot;symbolise an IRA surrender&quot; and was hardly a reasonable or justifiable demand by the British.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Adams argued that the British government wanted &quot;a surrender process as a precondition to all-party peace talks&quot; and was trying to achieve by stealth what it could not achieve militarily in 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sinn Fein national chairman, Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, said the weapons issue was a difficult and complex one which could only be resolved through dialogue. He said Sinn Fein had made its influence available to the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the fringe loyalist parties, the UDP and the PUP, failed to elicit any specific commitment on early release of paramilitary prisoners when they resumed their exploratory talks at Stormont yesterday with the Minister for Political Development, Mr Michael Ancram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after the meeting Mr Ancram said, however, that policy on prisoners could he developed in the light of changing circumstances.  He said there could be no general amnesty for paramilitary prisoners but indicated that the more normal society became in the light of the ceasefires the more movement there was likely to be on prisoners issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is a handing in of weapons or a decommissioning of weapons,&quot; he said, &quot;then obviously that will have an impact on the level of risk that exists within Northern Ireland and that must itself have an impact, in turn, on prison policy and on the review that we would then undertake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If peace was firmly established because there had been a decommissioning of arms, then certain aspects of prison policy, as much as any other policy, would he looked at again &quot;because the situation will merit a reviews, Mr Ancram said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loyalist groups had entered yesterday's talks with a set of demands for practical measures on the issue. The UDP is seeking a phased release with as a first step, the immediate reintroduction of 50 per cent remission and a review of all life sentence prisoners.  The PUP is pressing for a general amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UDP leader, Mr Gary McMichael, said after the meeting, he was disappointed at the government's lack of imagination. He believed it was essential for the government to make progress on the prisons issue to show the practical benefits of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UUP spokesman on legal affairs, Mr David Trimble MP, told the Commons earlier this week there was a serious argument for extending the English provisions for remission and parole to Northern Ireland, but if that were to happen it should apply to all criminal cases, not Just to those convicted of so-called terrorist or political offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, a number of leading UUP members have announced the formal inauguration next week of a Unionist Labour group, which will have the twin aims of maintaining the Union and pressing for equality of opportunity for all people of the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a background statement, the group's founding members say the UUP has been attracting members with a Labour orientation to politics for most of the 20th century. &quot;For the Union to mean anything it must also deliver on a whole range of socio-economic policies which are specially tailored to the needs of a population which overwhelmingly working class&quot;, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the objectives of the group are a free comprehensive health service the right to work and a minimum standard wage a comprehensive second-level education system a pensions and benefits system linked to the cost of living index socially acceptable housing provision an investment programme to stimulate the economy, and a hill of rights for Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT'S impossible to imagine terror in Rathmullan. There's no sign of life from the houses dotted along the roadside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local people are cautious when you ask questions. Yes, they remember Father Daniel Curran and the boys he brought to stay at his cottage. Nobody thought anything of it. The little band of visitors would ramble through the fields or stroll along the beach with their priest. Nothing seemed remiss.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, in March last year, the horror was exposed. A boy ran screaming from the cottage in the middle of the night. He banged on the door of the bungalow across the road. He was hysterical. He said that Father Curran had abused him. He was 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I met Father Curran twice,&quot; says Father Pat Buckley, the dissident curate in Larne, Co Antrim. &quot;He was an odd, remote man who found it difficult to communicate with people. He was a loner. He wasn't popular with the other clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was known as a heavy drinker. But nobody thought he was a paedophile.&quot; Father Curran was a keen bird-watcher. The BBC Radio Ulster programme, Clerical Habits, carried a profile of his hobby just months before he was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Curran (45) was born into a solid middle-class family in Newcastle, Co Down. His grandfather had been the town clerk. He had worked steadily, saved hard and built a ballroom, the Central. It thrived under his son Pat Daniel's father who became one of the North's leading dance hall operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat was a strict man. He forbade the sale of alcohol at dances. He was a firm father to his seven children. Daniel boarded at St MacNissis College in the Glens of Antrim. His father was delighted when one son became a solicitor and two entered the priesthood.  Daniel Curran was ordained in Belfast in June 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was curate in a number of parishes in the diocese of Down and Connor. He was moved to Larne, Co Antrim, in 1984 and transferred to west Belfast a year later. Father Buckley was the priest who replaced him in Larne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He hardly spoke a word to me. He didn't know how to engage in small talk,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Curran was moved from Larne because of his drink problem, Father Buckley says: &quot;I had to throw out all the bottles he left behind. He was living in a house on his own in the town and the Hierarchy thought it would be better to transfer him to Belfast where he could share a house with four or five other priests who would keep an eye on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Curran became a curate at St Paul's Church on the Falls Road. He remained there for nine years until his transfer to Ballymena in 1993. It was from St Paul's that he chose the boys that he would abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rathmullan is five miles outside Downpatrick. It's quiet, conservative and staunchly Catholic. Father Curran's cottage is n the Ballylucas Road. Locals said that it's owned by his father. It has no running water or electricity. Tilley lamps were used after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cottage looks on to the Co Down hills. Tyrella beach is just down the road. &quot;Father Curran would visit every month or so, mostly on a Sunday. He'd usually stay to Tuesday,&quot; says the farmer who lives next door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't know him well. He kept himself to himself. Sometimes he'd say 'hello' if he passed you on the road. Other times, he wouldn't bother. There'd always be three or four boys with him. We thought they were orphans from a home and that he was doing a good turn, taking them out of Belfast for a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One neighbour claims that she heard screaming from the cottage some nights. But she refused to believe that anything was wrong.  Other neighbours heard nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One night in March last year, a 14-year-old boy ran from the priest's house. He pleaded for help from the family at the bungalow across the road. He was soaking wet. Curran had thrown two buckets of water over him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was yelling that Father Curran had abused him,&quot; says one eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous. &quot;He was shaking violently.  He was badly bruised. His nose was bleeding. He was really frightened. He couldn't be calmed. He was like a wild horse. You would have needed a rope to tie him down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eyewitness says that Father Curran ran over to the house after his victim. &quot;He was in a state. Somebody had to lock him in a room.  The RUC arrived. The place was swarming with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other boys who were staying with the priest ran over that night as well. He had punched one of the boys in the face, split his lip, kicked him in the ribs, and bit his hand when he refused to go to bed with him. He had been drinking vodka earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was only one double bed in the cottage. The priest would try to abuse children as they slept. He would ply them with cider or beer first. Two boys were later found to have &quot;significant psychiatric or psychological problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the victims told how the priest had pulled down his jogging bottoms and ripped open his boxer shorts. &quot;I knew what he was doing was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it,&quot; he said.  Another said: &quot;I was afraid to tell anyone. I thought it would be a sin if I did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RUC searched the cottage that night. They found blood-stained clothing and bed linen. Father Curran was arrested. Three days later, he was charged with indecently assaulting two boys. The publicity surrounding his court appearance led to further allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months later he was charged with indecently assaulting nine boys between 1990 and 1994. They were aged from 11 to 14. Father Curran has spent 14 months at a Catholic centre in England which specialises in treating clergymen who have sexual disorders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Paul Lyons, who is monitoring his progress, claimed that the priest had suffered psychiatric symptoms since his early teens when his brother had died and his mother developed a nervous illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Curran was sentenced to seven years imprisonment yesterday.  &quot;I feel terribly sorry for his father and mother, Pat and Maureen,&quot; says one local man. &quot;They're very respectable people. I'm sure they're devastated by all this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE curtailment of next year's public expenditure was defended by the Minister for Finance, Mr Quinn, as an exercise in discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rejected claims by Fianna Fail of &quot;panic&quot; and &quot;mismanagement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is that the action announced last week is the very essence of planning ahead.&quot; There was no panic. There was &quot;prudent reflection&quot; about 1996 with the aim of ensuring that there would be capacity for further pro-employment action in the period ahead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are fully committed to ensuring that the fruits of economic growth are not fully absorbed by higher public spending, as has been the case in recent years, but are used in substantial measure for tax reform which will favour the incentive to work to tackle the poverty trap and encourage enterprise, development and growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr John O'Donoghue, the Fianna Fail spokesman on justice, said Fine Gael's reputation as the party of law and order was on the scrap heap as a result of the decision not to build Castlerea prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance contemptuously dismissed all the best-laid plans of the Minister for Justice. What is worse, they also contemptuously dismissed every serious proposal to tackle serious crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government had got its priorities wrong. &quot;Fianna Fail was able to provide for the building of the prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy in severely curtailed estimates. This Government, which increased public spending by 11 per cent in a short six months, could not build the prisons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Charlie Flanagan (FG, Laois-Offaly) said there was a contradiction between Fianna Fail's motion which condemned the curtailment of public spending next year and the day-to-day reality, where party spokesmen called for further resources for health, education, social welfare, agriculture and a host of other schemes requiring higher spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Government amendment expressing &quot;full confidence in the budgetary and economic policies&quot; of the Minister for Finance was passed by 74 votes to 62.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Minister for the Environment, Mr Howlin, has urged local authorities to &quot;take a hard look at progress, or sometimes the lack of it&quot; on the provision of accommodation for travellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Housing conditions for travelling families are still unsatisfactory in many instances and must continue to be a special concern for all of us. At national level, we provide the resources to finance suitable accommodation, whether by way of integrated housing, group housing or halting sites, depending on preferences and local circumstances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local authorities, as housing authorities, are responsible for delivering the accommodation required. While I readily recognise the difficulties, I must once again call on all local authorities both elected members and officials, to take a hard look at progress, or sometimes the lack of it, and consider how we can all do better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that settled communities often have anxieties about the provision of accommodation for travellers in their areas, but many of these anxieties can be overcome by local consultation and discussion, and the provision of small, well-designed sites in suitable locations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting his annual estimate to the Dail Committee on Finance and General Affairs, under the chairmanship of Mr Jim Mitchell (Fine Gael), the Minister said his Department would spend almost Pounds 900 million this year, about 90 per cent of it in grants and subsidies to local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that, although the Government had strong policies for the management of economic growth and development, it also recognised that, for development to be sustainable, environmental protection must constitute an integral part of the development process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sustainable development was defined in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development as development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs',&quot; Mr Howlin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fianna Fail spokesman on the Environment, Mr Noel Dempsey, was critical of the Department's approach to pollution. He said it tended to focus on &quot;end-of-pipe solutions&quot; rather than preventive measures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;IRELAND needed to be very cautious about proposals for changes that might fundamentally alter the institutional balance of the European Union, the Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were worrying signs in certain political groupings within the Community of a desire to override the position of smaller member-states, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the introduction of an Institute of European Affairs study by Mr John Temple Lang and Mr Eamonn Gallagher last night, Mr Ahern said there had been strong support in Ireland so far for European integration and a feeling that, on the whole, European membership had enhanced, rather than diminished, the value of Ireland's sovereign independence and its international influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one has tried to ride roughshod over us on vital matters, and our position has been respected,&quot; he added. Ireland had never been seriously obstructive of Community interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, he continued, there had been warning signals that no one should attempt to take Irish public opinion for granted, particularly if circumstances should change. Ireland's interest lay in Europe, and he hoped that nothing would be agreed at the next crucial Inter-Governmental Conference that would make that less obvious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said yesterday that the Government would press for an Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon, especially when it assumes the European Union presidency next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Spring said Ireland strongly supports the implementation of UN Security Council resolution 425 of 1978 calling for immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, where it occupies a 15 km-wide border strip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Irish Government fully supports resolution 425 and we want to see a complete withdrawal from south Lebanon,&quot; Mr Spring said after talks with his Lebanese counterpart, Mr Faris Bouez. &quot;That is what we are going to press for and that is the position of the European Union,&quot; he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Spring, who arrived in Beirut earlier in the day, said that when Ireland assumes the EU presidency in 1996 &quot;we will have a major role to play in the (ArabIsraeli) peace process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bouez also asked that Ireland reopen its Beirut embassy and consider extending the role of Irish UN troops in the aftermath of a peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the Tanaiste travels to Tibnin in southern Lebanon to visit Irish troops. The area was the scene yesterday of intermittent shelling between Hizbullah militias and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bouez was grateful for the role of the Irish UNIFIL contingent and expressed sadness at the fatalities among the Irish - 37 soldiers have died in Lebanon, 16 of them in action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Spring said Ireland took enormous pride in the role the Army had been able to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event of a peace settlement with Israel, Mr Bouez said, the Lebanese authorities would be keen to see Irish troops remain in the country under a new peacekeeping mandate. Mr Spring promised the Army would remain as long as the UN asked them to and the Government would consider sympathetically any request to change the mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also promised to consider reopening the embassy that Ireland closed during the Lebanese civil war all that remain are the relics of the ambassador's car under a collapsed wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bouez told the Irish delegation Beirut was now open to enormous business opportunities as the huge reconstruction process got under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Spring also met the Lebanese President, Mr Flias Hrawi, and the Amal leader, Mr Nabih Berri, president of the parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the streets evidence of both the scale of devastation suffered and the dramatic reconstruction programme is all around. Some $ 12 billion are being invested in rebuilding the country, $ 2 billion in the centre of Beirut alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once-thriving centre the Square of The Martyrs is now a barren, dusty wilderness only a cinema and a sad statue still stand.  The bulldozers have levelled what the warring factions left standing.  Now the city centre, about two square miles, looks like old newsreel films of Dresden after the blitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond its limits, the evidence of a society's collective death wish is still intact a skyline of skeletal remains of apartment blocks, many still inhabited, pock-marked by rockets and bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, despite the outward signs that Lebanon is putting its past behind it, and the flourishing of its historic entrepreneurial spirit, there is a distinctly less optimistic view here of the peace process than in Cairo. And many say the economic recovery 9 per cent growth predicted this year is skewed by huge construction contracts.  Other sectors of the economy are not so fortunate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon faces particularly acute problems. It will remain outside the peace talks until Syria can resolve its own problems, but Israel is refusing even to consider withdrawal from the south until the Lebanese disarm Hizbullah - putting the cart before the horse, the Lebanese say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some here warn of a failure by the international community to understand the severity of a dispute over water rights to the Litani River, which Israel is seeking to have declared an international river.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIRD, and last of the lunchtime series of new one act plays, at the Peacock is Brian Lynch's The Third Law of Motion, a two-hander with a quirky difference. Its two male characters are not unlike those in Neil Simon's The Odd Couple, here taken to extremes of personality and eccentricity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James and Gerry share a flat the very appearance of which reflects their contrasting natures. One side is maniacally, neat clean and precise the other is like a rubbish dump. Even the round table they share is covered with a cloth, part immaculate and part filthy. They live by a set of rules proposed and recorded by James, who is the flat's administrator and never leaves it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it goes, on to an ending which indicates continuation. We never learn how the two came together, or why they haven't killed each other already in this existential uniting of opposites, the author is properly more interested in travel than arrival. Frank McCusker is brilliant as the twitchy James, matched by Pat Kinevane's troglodyte Gerry, and Bid O Gallchoir directs this creatively off-beat play, good for rather more than a laugh.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LABOUR adviser Fergus Finlay's appearance before the Dail committee investigating the collapse of the last Coalition Government effectively brought an end to the events which produced some of the most compelling television ever broadcast in Ireland. Finlay impressed delivering his account with measured indignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His recollection of the experience is slightly different: &quot;I'm not a professional public speaker, so it was indignation, yes, but indignation heightened by sheer naked terror. I was so nervous I was convinced that everyone could hear the strange crashing sound, being made by my knees knocking together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes much of the interest in the appearance of the Labour advisers was due to the public &quot;not knowing what we looked like&quot;.  During his dramatic presentation, he compared the final hours of the Fianna Fail/Labour Coalition to Richard Nixon's departure from the White House. &quot;I was fascinated by the Watergate conspiracy. If I were ever to appear on Mastermind it would be my specialist subject.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many political correspondents regard Finlay as a hugely influential figure, he appears to have a more modest opinion of his powers and laughs at charges of Machiavellian manoeuvrings. &quot;I'm not abrasive or arrogant I'm an adviser. I suggest I don't make decisions. Dick takes my advice maybe about half of the time and I think it's very good advice. I draft speeches I don't write them. Any image of me as a puppet-master is absolute rubbish. Dick Spring is his own man. He is the Kerry son of a Kerry politician which means that you are instinctive, cautious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political correspondents complain that Finlay is aloof and inaccessible but he rejects this: &quot;I might not ring everyone up but I always return calls. But I have made a point of not discussing Anglo-Irish negotiations I've been involved in.&quot; He was present at the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 and was involved in the shaping of the Joint Framework. He adds: &quot;I have always briefed journalists on things relevant to what the party is doing. That's part of my job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that his personal style does not adhere to the &quot;I knew your father well&quot; school of Irish politics. He accepts that charges of smugness and superiority have been levelled recently at the Labour Party, especially now that it is in government at a time when Fianna Fail is shocked at not being in office and Fine Gael still surprised at finding itself sharing power by default. &quot;Far from being smug, I think there is far more self-criticism within Labour than in the other parties. No Labour Party leader arrives at a conference expecting not to have a hard time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although well aware that Labour is not the chosen party of many political journalists, he says: &quot;Politics and politicians, by and large, get the press they deserve.&quot; He certainly reads the newspapers and suggests that opinion writing has taken over from political analysis: &quot;More and more news has been replaced by colour writing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlay has an absolute belief in democratic socialism. It has a tremendous capacity to civilise and moderate.&quot; In common with many a young college radical he has come to acknowledge the practical limitations of revolution. &quot;I don't think it is possible to effect a revolution in a country like Ireland because of the ingrained values.  But neither do I think it revolution is actually necessary because of the commitment to community and community values here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he is devoted to politics, to the Labour Party and its leader and when asked whether he considers himself to be a participant in politics or an observer, his reply is curt: &quot;a participant&quot;, he would never seek public office. &quot;I'm too shy and reserved for that,&quot; he announces with mock irony and then adds, more seriously: &quot;Some people are natural politicians, and if you look at people in office even the ones you might not like as much as others they all have one thing in common. It's the quality that makes them politicians and not every one has that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITE, precise and very shrewd, Finlay looks like a liberal school principal the sort who would ask not only who broke the lab window, but why it had been broken. It's easy to imagine him as the history teacher favouring lived in tweed jackets, busily chewing cigarettes while listening intently for the most accurate explanation, tidying the grammar along the way. He is clearly a passionate if pragmatic idealist, and there is a vaguely chilling quality about the intensity of his dedication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a strategist, not a theoretician. One of the first things you learn in politics is the need for compromise. You develop a skill, not a taste for it. Compromise is a way of getting things done.&quot; Finlay refuses to allow any glib comment pass by unchallenged. He does not accept that there will never be a single-party government in Ireland again I believe there will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he feels the Irish people have been asked to accept one political disaster too many, and that no regard has been given by politicians to the existence of a collective memory, he sidesteps, perhaps unintentionally and says: &quot;The Irish electorate have almost never made a mistake.&quot; He maintains that the Irish are committed to politics. People here are involved tram the community level upwards.  ,It is very difficult to find an Irish person with no interest in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlay claims to be a reckless person, and enjoys not conforming to the cliched image of a political adviser as a faceless, suit-wearing civil servant. &quot;I'm not cautious at all.&quot; Most would disagree with that self-assessment - recklessness is not a characteristic one would associate with him, although he is not poker-faced and is known to conceal neither his disappointment nor disapproval of bad behaviour. He is also extraordinarily fair-minded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlay's feelings are easier to read than those of most political practitioners. Standing outside Government Buildings in 1992, the day protesters objected to the High Court judgment in the X case, he was upset as a man and as a father at the ruling the political relevance appeared secondary to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, exasperated by a newspaper story, based on a &quot;distorted version&quot; of Dick Spring's off-the-record comments about the President, Mrs Robinson, at a press lunch, Finlay approached this newspaper and wrote an account of the same events which was endorsed by others who were present. Finlay clearly resented that while onlookers accepted the truth once presented with it, they had been uncomfortably casual about setting the record straight themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing passes him unnoted, as is evident from his political thriller, A Cruel Trade (1990), a book which must have caused many politicians moments of unease. He is also a real-life socialist who lives modestly and by the doctrine he supports. Having lived in rented houses for more than 20 years, Finlay, his wife and four daughters bought their first house just two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in life he decided he wanted to be a trade-union official and is probably the only person to ever describe himself as one in theory before he did the job. &quot;My family were, I suppose, Fine Gaelish in that they voted Fine Gael. We had no political tradition.&quot; His interest in trade unionism came when he was 16, from reading Emmet Larkin's biography of Jim Larkin. &quot;I suppose it was a bit romantic. There's a romance and a magic about Larkin. He's a hero. He was big angry, impulsive and stubborn. Larkin's biography is my favourite book. I have three copies of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FERGUS Finlay was born in Dublin on June 1st, 1950, and looks mildly surprised on hearing himself confirm that he has reached 45.  &quot;There were really two families. There were two sons who died before I was born and then there were eight of us. I had four brothers and three sisters but my eldest brother died last year.&quot; The Finlays lived in Donnycarney but moved to Bray, Co Wicklow, when Fergus was eight, and he went to Presentation College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can remember Bray when there were hundreds of deckchairs out along the promenade and trainloads at people would come out there for the day. I had a happy childhood secure, settled, but my parents were nomadic types they enjoyed moving house. I was not marked or scarred by anything. But there was a lot of us and I know there were times of considerable struggle for my parents especially during the period when my father left Aer Lingus, to work for Shanahan Stamp Auctions and the company collapsed a couple of years later in a huge scandal it was the Greencore or the Telecom of its day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlay senior returned to Aer Lingus and, having been an executive there, had to start again at the bottom. &quot;We had a big old house in Bray and my mother took in lodgers at one stage.&quot; When his father was transferred to Cork, Fergus changed schools and lived in digs. &quot;I think that's when I started putting on weight. At 16 I was tall, slim and had a full head of hair and then, well and he gestures with stage regret to his present shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At UCC, where he studied economics and public administration, he was most committed to &quot;politics, drinking and women in that order&quot;.  On qualifying, he accepted a job with a small union, the Post Office Officials' Association, but soon realised that he was being paid out of its overdraft. At 22, he married Frieda Carpenter, an artist from Cork. Within a week, the union had failed and he was unemployed. They moved to Dublin and Finlay recalls a period when Frieda was doing ill List rations for the Evening Press and he was writing what he calls human interest articles, often to accompany Frieda's drawings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wrote under the name ergs Cunningham. Pieces like Living in digs in Cork, or On being unemployed that sort at thing articles from my own experiences. The Finlays were paid Pounds 3.50 each for their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some months we were living on Pounds 7 a week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After eight, months at unemployment aside from his occasional journalism a change of fortune occurred when another Larkin, Den is, approached Finlay with the offer of a job with the Workers Union of Ireland. Two days before he was due to start work, Frieda gave birth to their first child, Mandy. She had Down's Syndrome. We knew right away. Down's Syndrome babies are very pretty, like dolls. She had jaundice and she looked Chinese. We were very upset. But then I was angry. There was no counselling. The hospital's attitude was appalling. We were told she had 'no potential'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlay says parents of children with a mental disability are treated as if they too are disabled: &quot;Professional people are incredibly patronising and insensitive to the parents. It's just like the outrageous way people always ask the person with the man or woman in the wheelchair if he or she takes sugar in their tea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LATER this month, Mandy (22) will be representing Ireland in basketball at the Special Olympics. &quot;She's very good. She has this odd talent for putting the ball in the basket from any angle. I don't know where she gets it from not me, I'm a couch potato. We're all going off to New Haven to cheer her on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says his wife is the person who deserves the credit for Mandy's success. &quot;Frieda's a great ideas person.&quot; Of Mandy, he says &quot;she's wilful, lazy, stubborn like any teenager&quot;. The Finlays have three younger daughters: Vicky (18), Emma (16) and Sarah &quot;who is 12 going on 45&quot;. And he believes the girls have learnt a lot from Mandy. &quot;It's heightened their understanding and mine as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the trauma surrounding Mandy's birth, he was not ready to begin work. Denis Larkin insisted that he did and then told him to take three weeks' holidays. &quot;He paid me as well. I'll never forget his kindness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finlay joined the Labour Party in 1979 and continued his trade-union career with the local government union, now known as IMPACT, before going to work for a US multinational in Cork. Dick Spring became leader in October 1982, and the following January Finlay went to work with him. So began his political career as a party press secretary and spokesperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that Fine Gael/Labour Government fell in 1987, he started thinking about writing a thriller. &quot;I was conscious of the fact that no one had written a thriller using the sort of administrative detail of government that I knew. I've always liked Richard Condon's books because of the detail.&quot; He sent extracts to 48 publishers in Ireland and Britain: &quot;Sixteen replied four made offers.&quot; The first was from an unlikely source, Andre Deutsch, a literary publisher with a distinguished international list. &quot;I just accepted the contract. I didn't query anything on the business side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cruel Trade proves racy reading, with echoes of Forsyth's The DQV of the Jackal. &quot;I was not pleased when Bruce Arnold reviewed it as a political polemic.&quot; It is also peculiarly prophetic. Although written in 1989, he has a woman president and a politician who gets himself into trouble over tapes. &quot;It was written about three months before the Lenihan affair.&quot; Most of the 3,500 hardback copies were sold but it was never published in paperback. Finlay has also written two episodes of a proposed four-part screenplay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990 too he published his account of the Robinson election. My mother also published a novel and a collection of short stories.&quot; Of his career as a writer, he says: &quot;I always wanted to write a thriller Irish politics just cries out tar a thriller to be written about it.  I wanted to, write one that was deep and profound but it came out as a chase thriller. I was happy enough with that. But I will write something that will be deep and profound eventually.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHE'S back, and with a vengeance. The Iron Lady is once again dominating our television screens, spitting venom at her successor and haunting the Conservative Party. Yet this time, her icy glare, grey pallor and high-pitched voice fails to impress even some of her most ardent former admirers, as one quipped: &quot;The Barmy Baroness has struck again, either that or her Spitting Image puppet is on the rampage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while listening to Baroness Thatcher's rant, as she attempts to rewrite her 11-year premiership, one thing is certain by being a woman, she changed the nature of British politics forever.  Singlehandedly she destroyed the prehistoric political myth that men will not vote for women. And perhaps, even more importantly, working-class men were the backbone of her landslide victories.  Without Essex man, the lady would have been forced to turn long ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a point which, not surprisingly, has haunted the British Labour Party for the last decade. Traditionally Labour was a bastion for working men. This image was strikingly highlighted after the recent death of Lord Wilson, the most successful Labour leader who won four general elections during the 1960s and 1970s. Among all the eulogies from his grey-suited contemporaries, there was only one visible feminine presence, Barbara Castle. Still formidable at the age of 80, she is determined to &quot;always&quot; speak her mind. &quot;A born Madame Defarge,&quot; said one former Labour minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such politically incorrect language is supposedly not tolerated in Tony Blair's new Labour Party. However times are a changing. For the first time in the party's history, half of the British population are now excluded from even being short listed to represent Mr Blair's vision of a fair and equal society. Welcome to the 17 new Labour parliamentary candidates, dubbed the &quot;shoulderpad brigade&quot;, who were last month paraded before the media after being selected from all-women shortlists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Lady Thatcher, these new Labour women power dress and are perfectly coiffed. Credit for this official party policy must go to the woman known as the &quot;dark-haired, middle-class Barbie doll&quot;, Barbara Follett. But unlike Lady Castle, these women have been chosen because of their sex. In an attempt to increase the number of women Labour MPs from the current total of 39 to a predicted 89, the party will impose, if necessary, all-women shortlists in half of all the winnable marginal seats and safe Labour seats, where the sitting MP is retiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Follett lipstick by Chanel, grooming by South African martyr Steve Biko, domestic bliss dictated by Mao and married to a multi-millionaire is now the prospective Labour parliamentary candidate for Stevenage. But, and it is repeatedly stressed by her friends, she was not selected from an all-woman shortlist. Initially famous for persuading &quot;old&quot; Labour to swap their grey donkey-jackets for electable summer or autumnal shades (depending, of course, on the shadow minister's skin colouring), Mrs Follett is the &quot;architect and spirit&quot; behind this resurgence of women in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the horror of many die-hard feminists, her much quoted philosophy is that &quot;lipstick is power&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a woman who wears lipstick for political principles. As she explains: &quot;Lipstick isn't sexy. Lipstick is power. I hate wearing lipstick but it is important. They've done studies on it. I am right.  It's all about authority and women not being seen as victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure the success of this philosophy, Mrs Follett launched Emily's List to fund and encourage women to stand for a seat in parliament. The infamous Emily is not a suffragette but an uninspiring acronym borrowed from the American Democratic Party: Early Money Is Like Yeast (it makes the dough rise). Inevitably the concept has not translated well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is always the danger that Emily's List will be viewed as slightly elitist,&quot; said Nicola Kutapan, who stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Solihull during the last election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Emily launch was basically a cake-cutting embroidery event, and one of the concerns within the party was that it had been set up to promote a particular kind of Southern woman. There are advantages and disadvantages to someone like Barbara Follett being involved. The advantages are that she's a wonderful name, she can get money and all the rest of it, but there are negative aspects too the idea that you have to look pretty and wear the right colour lipstick to get on can be off-putting to a lot of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THESE fears have, not surprisingly, proved to be justified, with several prominent female shadow ministers recently attempting to distance themselves from an image they perceive to be embarrassing and passe. Last month Mrs Follett announced, on behalf of Emily's List, that they intended to ensure more lower-paid women enter Parliament as well. So much for equality and sisterhood eh? However the debate on all-women shortlists has divided the Labour Party throughout Britain, with local activists discussing women in terms that would make Mr Blair's ears burn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the men are sitting nursing their pints, their female comrades are notably more vitriolic in their condemnation, despising these &quot;selfish wimmin&quot;. &quot;Are we the 'little women' to be spoken dawn to and condescendingly given a helping hand? To treat women in this way is patronising. It is unpopular. It is manifestly unfair. Add the words undemocratic and foolish and you have the new quota system in a nutshell,&quot; argues Ann Carlton, a senior Labour Party policy expert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In words reminiscent of Camrade Stalin, the Labour MP Dawn Primarolo told dissenting constituencies last week that they had a completely free choice &quot;provided they chose a woman&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PERHAPS the saddest aspect of this &quot;sexual apartheid&quot; is that all the abuse shadowed the anger has over-shadowed the quality among the 17 women who have been chosen so far. They are, by and large, an impressive bunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret Moran, who represents Luton South, was the first woman leader of Lewisham Council and is a member of the Labour Party's Economic Policy Commission. Recently described as &quot;the dynamic, hard-working leader of a model borough with a reputation for toughness&quot;, she has already served her apprenticeship standing at the last election and would have been selected to be a candidate from a mixed list.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT have the long-running arguments about the charter for the new hospital at Tallaght got to do with the peace process in the North?  The answer is a great deal more than you might think, which is why the issue should be raised, if possible, in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The begrudging attitudes, which have surfaced over and over again during years of discussion, as to what practical guarantees should be given to the Adelaide Hospital in order to protect its &quot;Protestant ethos&quot;, are calculated to drive to despair anyone concerned with promoting trust between the two parts of this island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument was well put in a letter to this paper by James Wilson, the chairman of the New Ireland Group: &quot;The Adelaide issue may seem trivial in the world of Irish Realpolitik, yet it stimulates and reinforces the perception that while the Republic is unable (or unwilling) to cope with the modest socio-religious demands of a mere 3 per cent minority of its population, it will never gain credibility as the potential home and nation-state to one million Northern Protestants.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can already hear the quills being sharpened for letters to the editor protesting that the present argument is not about the Adelaide's &quot;Protestant ethos&quot;, but concerns the anxiety felt by doctors and nurses at the Meath Hospital over their professional prospects. They have chosen, quite cleverly, the emotional ground on which to fight, which is that they should not be barred from training or limited in their chances of promotion because they may have &quot;ethical objections&quot; to carrying out certain procedures like sterilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is central to the Adelaide's medical philosophy that it should be able to perform such procedures, quite legal within the State, but which other hospitals are barred from doing because of the rules of an ethics committee dominated by the teaching of the Catholic Church. In order to be able to continue carrying out this function the Adelaide believes, presumably, that it is necessary to train nurses and hire doctors who are in sincere agreement with its &quot;Protestant ethos&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, it could risk the possibility that a doctor and patient agree that a certain operation be carried out, only to find that the consultant or nurse in attendance has ethical objections to performing it. The main focus of this argument has been on sterilisation, but it is not difficult to foresee a situation when the spotlight could shift to much more controversial medical procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years the future of the Adelaide as a Protestant hospital has been discussed, anxiously, by the synods of the Presbyterian Church and the Church of Ireland and has been raised by unionist politicians not usually given to discussing the internal politics of the Republic. It is an issue which, in the North at least, embodies all those old fears about the meddling influence of the Catholic Church in matters of private conscience, the kind of thing summed up in those old scare stories about Catholic doctors having to choose to save the life of the child rather than the mother in a crisis pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT MAY be that many of these fears are out of date, but they still constitute a powerful barrier to nurturing confidence between the two communities on this island. Earlier this year the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, as part of its task of identifying &quot;obstacles in the South to relationships of trust&quot; commissioned a survey in which people, on both sides of the Border, were asked what they thought were the main obstacles to building better relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When people in the North were asked about obstacles existing in the South, 20 per cent cited &quot;religion and the influence of religion&quot; in the affairs of the Republic. By comparison, only 11 per cent identified Articles 2 and 3, or the weaker state of the Irish&nbsp;economy as barriers to a closer relationship. The figure is even more dramatic if the &quot;don't knows&quot; are excluded. Then, 34 per, cent cited &quot;religion and the influence of religion as an obstacle to progress.  Understandably perhaps, 38 per cent of Protestants questioned held this view, but so did 26 per cent of Northern Catholics and a further 38 per cent who refused to be identified as belonging to any church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a theme which has surfaced strongly in recent weeks. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation has now heard presentations from all the major Protestant denominations Presbyterian, Methodist and Church of Ireland, and also from a group of evangelical Protestants working in the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like much of what has happened during the public hearings at the forum, this bearing of witness has been deeply moving. But, despite the best efforts of the chairwoman, Judge Catherine McGuinness, one does not get the impression that all those invited to attend have found the experience an easy one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have come because they believe it is their duty to present the views, fears, sensitivities and griefs of their people, particularly of their people in the North. Sometimes this testimony has been most poignant when a Protestant clergyman from the Republic has struggled to explain and bridge the gap between members of the congregation in the North and the political community to which he or she belongs in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fear of Rome is still tangible&quot;, the fear of losing the right to private judgment in a society dominated by the teaching of one church, an evangelical Protestant told the forum. It's easy to laugh at the idea that many ordinary, decent Protestants see the Pope as a demonic figure, another said, &quot;but you can't laugh when you have to deal with it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUCH fears may be dispelled by contact, but even more by words and actions which demonstrate a real commitment to achieving a pluralist society. Delegations from the main Protestant denominations have now appeared before the forum and have submitted themselves to questioning, often quite critical, about the role of their own churches in dealing with sectarianism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still not clear whether the Catholic Church is willing to do the same. Officially, the line is that the bishops have not ruled out appearing before the forum, but the word on the grapevine is that they have certainly not ruled it in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One has some sympathy with the Hierarchy's reluctance to face questioning by politicians assembled in Dublin Castle, and the gaze of the much larger audience outside its gates. There are so many questions to be asked on so many issues, and the bishops may well feel that they have enough to face in dealing with the domestic problems facing them, without taking on the much larger issues of the future role of the church in Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, it is hard to see how they can refuse the challenge. This is the church which claims to offer moral guidance to the majority of people living on this island. They can hardly say (can they?) that they have nothing of worth to contribute to the debate on its future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL PAGE; EDITORIAL COMMENT; Pg. 15</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">555 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we are seeing is the arrogant action of a European colonial power&quot;. With these words the New Zealand prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, added graphically to the chorus of denunciation from around the world greeting Mr Jacques Chirac's announcement &quot;that France is to resume nuclear testing on Muroroa Atoll in the South Pacific.  &quot;Napoleonic arrogance&quot;, said another. It is indeed a most deplorable and retrograde step, which will have a damaging political effect equal to the environmental fallout.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word arrogant might well have been invented for the decision and not for the first time in the history of France. It refers to a presumptuous and undue appropriation of authority in a haughty and overbearing manner. Given the physical effects on other islands and states in the South Pacific and the message it sends out to states throughout the world that might be on the threshold of developing nuclear weapons not to mention the existing nuclear weapons club Mr Bolger's description is regrettably appropriate. The phrase &quot;European colonial power&quot; is technically correct too about sovereignty of the Mururoa Atoll, but it also refers, of course, to a wider set of assumptions about the behaviour of France and other European powers in the world. Regrettably, they are seen together despite the insistence of the French prime minister, Mr Juppe yesterday in the National Assembly, that nuclear testing is altogether a matter of France's own national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is disingenuous of Mr Juppe to put it this way on the very day that President Chirac was travelling to meet Mr Clinton in the White House and then to hold the first EU-US summit meeting with him and the president of the European Commission. This may fit in perfectly well with Mr Chirac's need to put a muscular stamp on his French presidency and with the classical pursuit of French interests through the EU but it is an unacceptable conflation of French and European representative roles at an important symbolic moment for both of them, less than two weeks before the EU Council meets in Cannes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the more reason for France's EU partners, Ireland included, to dissociate themselves vigorously from the decision to resume nuclear testing. It cannot but damage the good will and integrity of next year's negotiations on creating a more coherent and effective EU foreign and security policy. This can be seen in the tone of reactions from the other member-states, which range from regret to angry denunciation. The British, however, have been more muted in their criticism, reflecting not only their own nuclear status, but the&quot; marked improvement in Anglo-French relations signalled in Mr Chirac's discussions last weekend with Mr John Major. Their co-operation in creating the rapid reaction force will be put to a real test if the Bosnian government launches an offensive in coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This assertion of French national interest in an increasingly integrated and interdependent world jolts the international political system into a new awareness of its priorities. There is still time for the decision to be reconsidered, although the loss of face and pride involved makes it most unlikely that the French government will do so. It must expect a continuing negative reaction around the world as the price of its arrogance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir, - Now we know all or do we? In The Irish Times (June 8th), we read on the front page that the Government must cut back on spending, meaning of course, less jobs. The Minister for Finance, Mr Quinn, was responding to the dictate contained in a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to page 14 of the same issue the headline is More jobs and higher wages may fuel inflation. This is the view of the Paris-based OECD. The continuing fall (mark you) in unemployment could force wage rates and prices upwards it is warned. Where the continuing fall in unemployment is, puzzles me when one reads the same day that our largest industry, the ESB, is getting ready for massive redundancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe, as the OECD reveals, this supposed fall in joblessness is not caused by the creation of new jobs here, but by more emigration to Britain which, according to the OECD, is as a result of an improvement in the British labour market and the powers that be here in the Republic are either fooling themselves or fooling the public into thinking there are more jobs being created. The truth being of course that because of emigration less dole is being drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have written this letter only in the hope that some economist of repute would give his or her viewpoint on this whole extraordinary mess which we have got ourselves into since we joined the European Union. - Yours, etc.,</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir, Can it be coincidence, that the nations of the East of Europe subjected under the Soviet Union are so like the nations of the West under the EU? Are we really free nations? We seem to be herded into the same sort of pen under the policy of interdependence. We are controlled internationally on the political, military and economic levels. Nationalism is a dirty word and must disappear. Could that be why our politicians, who only represent a small percentage of the electorate, are so keen to give up our neutrality and to join NATO?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only hope we have in Ireland is to preserve our Constitution and the only opportunity we have of saying &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; is through a referendum. Laws are being passed every day and very few of, the electorate even, know what is being decided in our name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had the first World War and the League of Nations. We had the second World War and the UN. The third world war is long overdue.  Will we have a world government next? Certainly the UN for some time now is taking a relentless bashing worldwide and in the media. The UN's charter could be changed very easily to facilitate a world government all the special agencies are in place UNESCO, ILO, WHO, etc., all in existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever would happen if all the mortgages held in Ireland on homes, businesses, land, etc. were to be called in on the same day, not forgetting our large Government debt there would be absolute chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass media is being used to undermine the values of the people in our own homes. I hope we will not be conditioned when it comes to the referenda that are shortly to take place. I hope we will not be an ill-informed, apathetic public: Edmund Burke once said.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton's 10-year plan to cut the US budget deficit comes as the heads of the seven main industrial nations the Group of Seven meet in Halifax, Canada for their annual summit. The timing of the announcement was surely no coincidence. Mr Clinton, as well as trying to gain the domestic initiative was, no doubt, keen to head off the usual criticism of US budget policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Group of Seven have an important economic agenda, apart altogether from their discussions of political topics like Bosnia.  The trade frictions between the US and Japan are sure to surface, although substantive discussions may have to wait until the two sides get together in Geneva next week. Both sides must realise that this dispute will have be sorted out soon to avoid a point of no return in the imposition of threatened sanctions by the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reform of the two major international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, will also be high on the agenda. The Mexican peso crisis earlier this year highlighted the need for an international monitoring mechanism to provide an early warning system. The IMF may get this job, although the G7 nations remain divided on its proper role and how to pay for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As ever, the leaders will also turn their attention to the overall state of the international economy. They will, as they do every year, urge each other to reduce budget deficits, control inflation and try to set the path for non-inflationary growth. They are likely to avoid discussing the recent weakness of the US dollar for fear of setting off a scare on the markets and in the knowledge that international central banks are finding it increasingly difficult to battle against the might of international financial flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton will tell his colleagues that the US budget plan, involving $ 1.2 trillion in spending cuts over ten years in a drive to balance the budget, shows that the US is prepared to do its bit. However he will be the first to realise that the budget plan is a long way from being accepted. Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives have already won acceptance of a plan to eliminate the deficit over seven years. Mr Clinton is now trying to set the agenda in the forthcoming debate, but risks alienating his own Democratic party in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">internationally, plans to cut the US budget deficit will win applause. For years the deficit has proved a major drain on international capital. it has also contributed to a massive US trade deficit, which in turn has been a significant factor behind the destabilising weakness of the US dollar. The G7 leaders will surely urge that whatever budget strategy is agreed in Washington in the months ahead, it should ensure a sustained reduction in the deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the other G7 members such as France and Italy face equally difficult budgetary dilemmas of their own. All realise that international capital markets will increasingly extract a price in terms of higher interest rates from those who do not get their finances in order. For the Europeans, there is the additional pressure, of the Maastricht convergence criteria for those wishing to Join a single currency. The summit leaders will commit themselves to fiscal discipline. Whether the US and the other main industrial nations can follow through on these promises remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HALIFAX, CANADA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LEADERS of the seven richest nations gather in the poorest corner of Canada today for a frugal summit whose location is designed to show that the maritime provinces will not be forgotten if the country is split in two by an independent Quebec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top of the Group of Seven (G7) agenda will be reform of the world's financial institutions, the war in Bosnia, the looming trade war between the USA and Japan, US efforts to isolate Iran, NATO expansion, and Russian claims to full G7 membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations are low as the leaders of the US, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan gather on the cool Atlantic coast.  Officials gloomily predict that the chances of a breakthrough in any major issue are remote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Jean Chretien, has made this what he calls &quot;a Chevrolet summit, not a Cadillac one.&quot; He has placed an absolute limit of 28 million Canadian dollars (Pounds 12.6 million) on summit expenditure, $ 1.3 million less than in Toronto in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To cut costs, two tables, one to seat nine, the other to seat 30, were borrowed, from Italy and shipped to Halifax on the homeward bound Canadian cruiser, HMCS Fredericton. They were used in the last G7 summit at Naples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 6,000 visitors, including journalists, official and security personnel, will swell the 114,000 population, of Halifax, where hotels have been booked solid for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnia will dominate political discussions, given the presence of the Contact Group for Bosnia Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US plans to lobby for the isolation of Iran, but Japan and Europe favour dialogue. The G7 may, however, point up &quot;the unacceptability of Iran's behaviour with respect to terrorism and subversion of the Middle East peace process,&quot; according to US officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE month after their controversial Moscow summit, President Clinton and the Russian President, Mr Boris Yeltsin, will again spar at a separate summit on Saturday over Iran's nuclear programme and the expansion of NATO. Russia does not belong to the G7 but has a seat at political discussions. The war in Chechnya complicates its case for full membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clinton will also meet the British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, on Friday when Bosnia and Northern Ireland will be on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also to meet the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Tomiichi Muryama, but a breakthrough in the US-Japanese trade dispute, which threatens world economic stability, is not expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington plans to impose sanctions on Japanese luxury cars on June 28th if no agreement is reached on opening Japan's car market.  Officials of the two countries will meet in Geneva next week to try to break the deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some pre-summit decisions have already been reached on reforming financial institutions to cope with the demands of an increasingly global marketplace. Since Naples six months ago a series of crises has disrupted economies around the world and undermined confidence in growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mexican peso crisis, in particular, demonstrated the need for a coherent, international monitoring mechanism. The summit will debate the future of the Washington-based International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose director, Mr Michael Camdessus, has positioned the IMF to manage such a mechanism, bringing together the world's wealthiest nations and rapidly developing countries such as Brazil and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the G7 countries are divided over the need for more funding for the IMF and what powers it eventually should have.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUILDING materials group Grafton stands to receive a windfall of more than Pounds 500,000 from the sale of its shares in British building supplies group Erith which is the subject of a Pounds 55.4 million agreed takeover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham, another British building supplies group, announced its intention to make a recommended offer for Erith yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graft on has built up a 3 per cent strategic stake in Erith over the last five years, according to a spokesman for the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average cost of the shares was 60p, with a total investment of Pounds 900,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grafton is expected to accept the cash option being offered by Graham, which is 104p per share. The sale should result in a net gain of around Pounds 500,000 for Grafton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also announced two new board appointments yesterday.  Ms Gillian Bowler, the joint managing director of Budget Travel, is to join the board as a non-executive director, as is Mr Richard Jewson, the former chairman and chief executive of British building materials group Mayer International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gillian Bowler's entrepreneurial management experience and Richard Jewson's extensive international experience in builders merchanting and other industries will be important assets in out future development,&quot; commented Mr Michael Chadwick, executive chairman of the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the directors of Grafton earned fees of Pounds 4,500 a year each.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MR Kenneth Clarke, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, yesterday extended the government's existing target for UK inflation beyond the next general election and said he would not be tempted by a &quot;politically motivated dash for growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clarke used his third annual Mansion House speech to warn that Britain could not afford populist inflationary binges&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clarke added that he wanted to cut taxes in time, but to do so he must keep tight control of government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clarke reaffirmed his commitment to ensure that underlying inflation excluding mortgage interest payments is 2.5 per cent or less at the end of this parliament. He added that this objective would now be extended indefinitely beyond the next election. The target for underlying inflation up to the end of the parliament is 1 to 4 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night's speech came too late to influence the markets, where the dollar weakened against other major currencies after the Bundesbank at a fortnightly meeting said it would not change key interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dollar was quoted as trading at DM1.3985, down from DM1.4005 earlier and DM1.4098 late on Tuesday. In Dublin the pound gained almost a cent to 51.6386.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton's budget proposals presented late on Tuesday which envisage $ 1.2 trillion of cuts over 10 years had a mixed political response, with criticism from some of the Democratic Party and a cautious welcome from Republicans.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Supreme Court yesterday adjourned for one week an application to have Irish Press plc pay the estimated Pounds 2 million costs of court litigation involving the Irish Press group of newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingersoll Irish Publications Ltd, the former equal shareholder in Irish Press Newspapers (which published the three newspapers), claimed it should be paid the costs of two High Court hearings and a Supreme Court appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month the Supreme Court upheld the Ingersoll company's appeal against a High Court order directing it to pay damages of Pounds 6 million to IPN and Pounds 2.75 million to Irish Press plc. The Supreme Court also found that Ingersoll's 50 per cent shareholding, (fixed earlier by the High Court at Pounds 2.25 million), now had only a nominal value.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Supreme Court appeal, Ingersoll's counsel, Mr John Gordon SC, said his client was no longer contesting a finding of oppress ion against it and was not contesting an order that it transfer its shares to Irish Press plc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of costs, he said it was looking for the costs of the original High Court hearing which lasted 38 days costs of the assessment of damages which ran for 14 days and the costs of the Supreme Court appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In relation to the High Court assessment of damages, Mr Johndon for Ingersoll said his client had effectively overturned the findings of second High Court hearing and costs should follow the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingersoll had handed over its shareholding as ordered to Irish Press plc. His client had a Pounds 1 million loan which was secured on premises occupied by IPN and had unsecured loans of Pounds 3 million loaned to Irish Press Publications (owner of the titles).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gordon said two matters had occurred recently which had made Ingersoll's loss greater. Last December Irish Press plc had sold half of his client's share to the Irish Independent for Pounds 1.25 million. The fact was that Irish Press plc had received the Pounds 1.25 million. It was a company unaffected by the litigation. This money had not gone to IPN which published the newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of that transaction, Irish Press Publications granted a charge to Irish Independent in the sum of Pounds 2 million which his clients had been unable to do anything about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Colm Allen SC, for Irish Press plc, asked for an adjournment to consider Mr Gordon's submissions as the question of costs was fundamental as far as his clients were concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice, Mr Justice Hamilton, adjourned the hearing to Wednesday next.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DUBLIN pushed ahead as expected with the initial strength of European bond markets before New York opened feeding through into the financial stocks in particular. AIB was up 4p at 296p, while Bank of Ireland gained 4p also to close at 347p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any bond market progress in Britain will hinge on the market's' reaction this morning to last night's Mansion House speech by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke. If his speech is well-received then further gains can be expected, which should have a knock-on effect on Irish stocks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second-line financials also made gains, with Anglo Irish Bank up 1/2p to 52 1/2p, while Irish Life put on 1p to reach 208p. Irish Permanent recovered some of the ground it lost in recent days gaining 5p to 310p. Turnover figures for Tuesday confirm that the falls in the Irish Permanent occurred in reasonably thin trade, with Pounds 650,000 worth of shares being sold on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was heavy dealing in Smurfit, with a million shares changing hands in London at 172p, but the share closed down 1/2p at 171 1/2p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the second-liners continue to make gains, with Irish Continental jumping 20p to 445p and Ardagh moving ahead 1p to 143p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greencore continues to set new highs, up another 2p to 450p in a late trade on Tuesday that was only recorded yesterday. There was good two-way trade in Golden Vale which flew fund managers to Holland to view the Vonk cheese plant that has been the cause of so much grief in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund managers reactions were mixed as evidenced by the almost equal numbers of sellers and buyers. The share closed up 1p on 69p.  Elsewhere among the food stocks, Avonmore dropped 1p to 136p, while Kerry traded unchanged at 400p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waterford Foods did not trade, with the market expressing scepticism about its reported interest in buying the Cheese Co in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market was similarly unimpressed by Aran Energy's claim that BP's decision to start preparatory work on developing production platforms for the west of Shetland was good news for Aran, which has an interest in one of BP's fields.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BRITISH equities delivered a disappointing performance yesterday, ignoring another burst of takeover speculation and reflecting a decidedly edgy opening performance by Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter was unnerved at the opening by a weak performance by US Treasury bonds, which in turn affected bunds, bonds and gilts across European markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealers ascribed the fall in US markets to growing unease about the dollar which fell below the crucial $ 1.40 level against the deutschmark yesterday after news that the Bundesbank had left German interest unchanged. Theme had been no real conviction in the market that the Bundesbank would lower German rates but dealers said sentiment in the US currency had worsened after the news was made public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100 index of leading stocks ended the session a net 8.2 lower at 3,339.8, while the FTSE Mid-250 index was more resilient, closing only 3.7 off at 3,653.9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no real build-up on downside pressure in London, dealers said. &quot;The market feels slightly worn out,&quot; said the head of derivatives activity at one of the leading British securities houses.  He said that most of the domestic economic news emerging in recent sessions was viewed as moderately bullish for gilts and, therefore, for equities but that this was balanced by some fairly aggressive selling pressure in the futures and options markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consensus view was that the market was unlikely to crack on the downside in the short term, unless Wall Street stages a substantial reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy head of trading at one of the big European securities houses noted that any significant dips in the equity market were seen as offering opportunities for those holding short trading books to cover those positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good reasons for the market's reluctance to move ahead strongly on Tuesday emerged early in the session with news of a Pounds 137 million rights issue from FKI, the electrical engineering group, and the placing of 57.5 million shares in TLG, by its previous owner, Thorn EMI and Investcorp, a Bahrain-based investment company. Together the two deals will take out over Pounds 220 million of investment funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market was in good form at the opening when the FTSE 100 opened more than 13 points higher, with early buying interest again fuelled by takeover talk concerning Cable &amp; Wireless, Zeneca and Thorn EMI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnover in equities expanded to 743.2 million, well above recent levels, although 20 per cent of the total was accounted for by the 153 million shares traded in TLG.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials rose 6.57 points (0.15 per cent) to 4,491.08 with some 330 million shares changing hands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said there was little reaction to the Labour Department's report that US productivity rose an annualised 2.7 per cent in the first three months of the year, well above forecasts of 0.7 percent to 1.3 per cent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NICK FALDO, winner of the title on a record three successive occasions, will not be competing in the Murphy's Irish Open next month. His absence is, in effect, the price that Irish fans will have to pay for Faldo's commitment to the USPGA Tour this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than rule himself out entirely when we spoke at Shinnecock Hills yesterday, he said: &quot;It doesn't look good . . . not good.&quot; In his code, however, it amounted to the same thing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, he was off for a final practice round in preparation for a championship that seems to have captured his imagination like no other in recent years. &quot;This is the number one event in the world that I'd like to win. And the sooner the better,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mood was relaxed as he looked out at the rain. &quot;I suppose you guys will be coming over to the British Open for a little sunshine this summer,&quot; he teased. &quot;With this weather on this golf course, we now have a US Open that's more British than the British Open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happens, Shinnecock already holds a special significance in Faldo's career. While contemporaries such as Sandy Lyle Bernhard Langer and Seve Ballesteros were competing here in the US Open in 1986, Faldo was not on the invitation list. That was the critical period he describes as his &quot;dark age&quot;, when his swing was being re shaped under the tuition of David Leadbetter. It meant his only &quot;major&quot; appearance over here was in the USPGA Championship in which, almost predictably, he missed the cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He decided to opt out old the Kemper Open last weekend to give the maximum attention to his preparation for the US Open. So, Faldo arrived at Shinnecock on Monday, June 5th, for his first look at the course. After that and two further days' practice, he decided he had seen enough - &quot;I immediately felt comfortable about the place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he has set his sights on capturing a title that first fired his imagination back in 1972, a month short of his 15th birthday. &quot;My earliest memory of the US Open is of Jack Nicklaus hitting the stick with a one iron tee shot at the short 17th in the final round at Pebble Beach,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I feel as if I've come home. I feel more at ease here than on any other US Open course. Though it's not quite a true links, it's pretty close to it. And the most important thing as far I'm concerned is that it's a great course. Whoever plays solidly here from tee to green will win the championship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the Englishman claimed that the rain would not seriously affect the playing conditions from tee to green, insofar as Shinnecock is always lush. &quot;But it's going to change the greens, which is a pity,&quot; he said. &quot;The rain has deprived them of their traditional fire. This means you can now lob the ball onto them in the knowledge that it will stop, whereas last week it was necessary to play a bump and run shot when you missed a green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In common with USGA officials, Faldo has no fears of the rain affecting the start of the championship. &quot;The course drains unbelievably well,&quot; he said. &quot;There would need to be pretty serious downpours before we had cause for anxiety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be his ninth US Open. His only missed cut in eight previous challenges was at Oakmont last year when rounds of 73 and 75 amounted to one stroke too many. Prior to that, he was tied fourth behind Tom Kite at Pebble Beach in 1992, tied third behind Hale Irwin at Medinah in 1990 and, of course, his best effort had been in 1988 when he lost a play off to Curtis Strange at Brookline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, his only appearance on the European Tour this season has been in the Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth where a miserable closing rounds of 74 pushed him down to a share of 12th place behind Langer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is all about goals,&quot; he said. &quot;You just work hard to try and achieve these things and when you get there, you don't become over excited. It's what you're trying to do.&quot; Then, almost as an afterthought, he concluded: &quot;It is going to be a tough week.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> STAN COLLYMORE will earn former club Southend around Pounds 800,000 when he completes a British record move to Merseyside. Liverpool and Everton are competing to sign the 24 year old England striker after both agreed to meet Nottingham Forest's Pounds 8.5 million asking price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoever signs Collymore will be looking at a total outlay in excess of Pounds 10 million, with VAT adding on the best part of Pounds 1.5 million - the amount former England captain Bryan Rob son cost Manchester United from West Bromwich in 1981. Add to that any signing on fee the player may negotiate and the cost is well into eight figures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal will earn a big bonus for Southend, who sold Collymore for a basic Pounds 2 million two years ago after Forest agreed to pay a 15 per cent share of any profit made in a subsequent transfer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relegated Crystal Palace will also benefit when they pick up a Pounds 115,000 consolation prize from Southend after selling the player for a giveaway Pounds 80,000 in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southend have already collected an additional Pounds 500,000 from Forest after Collymore met a scoring target and helped them into the Premiership, then went on to earn international recognition in the recent Umbro Cup game against Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's part of our normal trading activities,&quot; said Southend chief executive John Adams. &quot;Now both Southend and Palace will benefit from the profit generated by the sale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week non league Hayes pocketed a staggering Pounds 600,000 when former player Les Ferdinand moved from QPR to Newcastle for Pounds 6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That transfer was Pounds 1 million short of the top British deal - Andy Cole's move to Manchester United which has stood since January and will now be overtaken by Collymore. It reflects rocketing transfer activity with more than Pounds 155 million spent by clubs in the last 14 months.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PRESIDENT Clinton is &quot;concerned&quot; about the Northern Ireland peace process and is expected to discuss its progress with the British Prime Minister, Mr Major, on Friday, according to a White House spokesman, Mr Mike McCurry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British embassy spokesman confirmed that an &quot;informal&quot; meeting of some 15 minutes had been arranged between Mr Clinton and Mr Major in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Friday. The meeting will take place on the margins of the three-day Group of Seven (G7) summit of the world's industrialised nations, which begins tomorrow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between London and Washington have encountered new difficulties in recent days over the Irish issue. Up to last night, Mr Major had still not given his assent to the dates suggested by the White House on Thursday for Mr Clinton's proposed visit to London and Belfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British embassy spokesman confirmed yesterday that it had told the White House there were &quot;scheduling problems&quot; over the dates suggested by the US President November 29th to December 2nd for a transatlantic visit taking in both the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The British side earlier rejected proposed dates in August as unsuitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute over timing has now dragged on for four weeks, and some observers in Washington feel the British tardiness in agreeing dates may reflect in part residual resentment over Mr Clinton's decision to lift the fund raising ban on the Sinn Fein leader, Mr Gerry Adams, in March. Mr Major subsequently refused to take a telephone call from Mr Clinton for a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the President was concerned about the way the process appeared to be moving into a fragile phase, Mr McCurry said: &quot;The President is concerned that the peace process moved forward and that he continues to remain active in it. He is concerned because it is an issue he wants to Spend some time on because it is important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President &quot;has a lot of confidence in those who are guiding the negotiations, that they are committed to making progress&quot;, the White House spokesman told a group of European journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But... we have played a helpful role in nurturing that process land he intends to continue to do so. Availability to travel is one aspect of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was his &quot;strong suspicion&quot; that if the two leaders had a chance to talk in Halifax &quot;they will certainly review the peace process&quot;. Mr McCurry also said that they had been preparing to announce the President's visit at the White House economic summit on Ireland on May 25th, but they held back because they were going back and forth on dates&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Clinton's anxiety about the peace process comes against a background of a continuing impasse over decommissioning and a rising concern on the Irish side about the perceived lack of momentum on the issue of prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the White House felt it was time Sinn Fein delivered on decommissioning, Mr McCurry recalled that Mr Clinton had stressed the importance at the economic summit for real progress on decommissioning. Commenting on the substance of the dialogue, however, could affect the ability of the parties to reach peace and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech Mr Clinton said: &quot;To all who are observing the ceasefire, I appeal to you to take the next step and begin to discuss serious decommissioning of weapons. Paramilitaries on both sides must get rid of their bombs and guns for good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Labour TD Mr Declan Bree last night criticised the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for what he described as its late objections to the proposed building of a fibreboard manufacturing plant in Drumsna, Co Leitrim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bree, the deputy for Sligo/Leitrim, said the objections by the Department could now delay the construction of the Masonite plant and they should have been raised much earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fully appreciate that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has a responsibility to protect the amenities of the Shannon and the tourist potential of the Shannon navigation,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, I find it unacceptable that such objections have only been raised at this late stage in the planning process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what could be seen as a deft attempt to divert criticism from his fellow West of Ireland Labour deputy, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Mr Michael D. Higgins, Mr Bree attacked officials within the Department rather than the Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What have the officials from the Department been doing for the past six months? Were they not provided with details of the project by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Enterprise and Employment and Forbairt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bree said that he had already contacted the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Agriculture and Forestry seeking details relating to the level of cooperation and co-ordination between Government Departments and statutory authorities on the Masonite project. The questions will also raise the concern of people in the region regarding the objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Fine Gael senator, Mr Gerry Reynolds, said last night he was concerned at allegations that the Minister had decided to make planning objections without contacting any of his colleagues or those interest groups in the local area where Masonite will be located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Reynolds said he was seeking a meeting with the Minister to discuss the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a Pounds 90 million project which will create over 300 much needed jobs for Co Leitrim,&quot; he said. &quot;The potential social and economic development of this project is incalculable to this county which has suffered more than its fair share of job losses in the past three to four years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS year's Leaving Certificate business organisation papers received a mixed reception from students and teachers alike, with reactions ranging from general satisfaction to incensed frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Claire Hogan, a higher-level student from Sion Hill in Blackrock, Co Dublin, said she felt that the examiners had been out to get us&quot;. She was surprised by the non-appearance of topical issues such as building societies and the stock exchange and felt that the high-mark questions had concentrated on specialised areas. &quot;But I'm not going to repeat business organisation,&quot; she concluded, with steel in her voice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Frank McKenna, national treasurer of the Business Studies Teachers Association of Ireland and a teacher at Edmund Rice College CBS, Callan, Co Kilkenny, said that a number of people had been disappointed at the non-appearance of high-profile subjects at higher level, while others felt it was a very long paper, but &quot;a student who covered the entire course well would have little cause for complaint&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McKenna said it was practically impossible to predict what might appear. However, some topics that were tipped, such as the Competition Act and taxation, did feature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Joseph Gallagher, a teacher at Firhouse Community College in Tallaght, Dublin, and a TUI subject representative for business organisation, regarded the questions at both levels as challenging but fair, with a good element of topicality. &quot;There has been a general improvement in layout and level of difficulty in the last couple of years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, Mr Gallagher viewed the higher-level paper as a little more difficult than in previous years, with a case study which was &quot;reasonable&quot; if a little specific to agriculture. He called questions eight and nine, on taxation and banking respectively, &quot;entirely legitimate questions&quot;, but said students who had also studied economics would have had a slight advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mary Lonergan, principal of Rathmines Senior College, Dublin, and a business studies teacher, described the higher-level paper as &quot;very fair and well-balanced&quot;, though students' first impressions might have led them to believe it was more difficult than it actually was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said asking students for a brief description of the Culliton Report was a contradiction in terms, and that the 90-mark questions required a very specific type of answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unanimity was also lacking in views of the ordinary-level paper.  &quot;I wasn't happy with it,&quot; Mr McKenna said, describing it as &quot;a bit stiff&quot; for the weaker student. He pointed out that what has traditionally been a fair paper was marred this year by sections which might have been more suited to the higher-level paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Grainne Murphy, a teacher in Colaiste Dhulaigh, Coolock, Dublin, regarded the ordinary-level paper as being of &quot;a stiff enough standard but very fair. I did feel that the questions were very well-worded and unambiguous so there was not much likelihood of students inadvertently dropping parts of questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her students would have liked to have seen questions on the associated banks and the wholesaler/ retailer, Ms Murphy said, but overall she was &quot;quite happy&quot; with the paper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Belfast aerospace company Shorts is facing court action over an incident last year when 18 workmen were taken to hospital after inhaling toxic fumes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health and safety inspectorate of the Department of Economic Development has issued two summonses against the company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first alleges that Shorts contravened the Health and Safety at Work regulations on August 16th, 1994, by failing to ensure the safety of employees when hydrogen sulphide gas was generated, contaminating its Airport Road factory and the surrounding area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second summons alleges that the company failed to ensure the safety of an employee of a contract cleaning company and several employees of a government department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged that they were exposed to risk when hydrogen sulphide gas was generated, contaminating the factory, the surrounding area and the sewer system associated with the factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summonses were adjourned until September 5th at Belfast Magistrates Court yesterday. Shorts is contesting the summonses and has engaged Mr John Gillen QC to represent it. A date for the ease will be fixed in September.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HIGH unemployment in the EU and the crisis in Bosnia should be the priority items on the agenda of the summit in Cannes later this month, according to the European Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Bosnia, the parliament voted narrowly in favour of the UN remaining there but, if its forces could not &quot;act effectively&quot; Bosnia should be &quot;provided with the means of self-defence&quot; according to the UN Charter. The powerful Socialist group opposed this qualified appeal to lift the arms embargo, but was narrowly outvoted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliament also supported the creation of the British-French Rapid Reaction Force which while making use of NATO facilities, will be under European command. But the resolution also said the force would have to be increased to enforce the protection of the safe areas. It also voted for the immediate release of all the UN hostages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MEPs supported the French government call to &quot;broaden&quot; the mandate of Unprofor in order to reduce the &quot;vulnerability&quot; of UN troops and to strengthen their ability to fulfil their humanitarian tasks by providing a credible defence of the so-called safe areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliament also called on the EU summit &quot;to take decisive action to restore public confidence in the European Union, notably by taking measures to strengthen the Union's contribution to the fight against unemployment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Fianna Fail delegation, Mr Gerard Collins, told the parliament the &quot;vast majority of people are emphatically not interested in EU institutional questions nor are they particularly interested in the mechanics' for achieving a single currency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-running debate on these subjects could only be made relevant to the general public &quot;if they can contribute to and be seen to contribute to tackling the major issues of widespread concern, which I believe to be unemployment and the inter-linked problems of drug abuse and crime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the drugs issue, Mr Collins said it was vital that the EU police co-operation agency, Europol, should be properly financed and equipped &quot;to begin its task of bringing the drug smugglers to justice&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creation of Europol was an integral part of the Maastricht Treaty and, as one of those involved in the drafting of it, he &quot;deplored the delay&quot; in making it operational. He called on the French presidency to make this a priority for the Cannes summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pat Cox of the Liberal group said the summit must result in &quot;a decisive commitment to strengthen the fight against unemployment&quot;.  Even with sustained growth and recovery up to 1997, the EU would still have a 9 per cent unemployment rate of up to 12 million people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PUBLIC spending decisions were being taken now to allow Departments to plan properly for next year, the Minister of State for Finance, Mr Hugh Coveney, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was responding to a Fianna &quot;Fail motion condemning the &quot;panic&quot; decisions announced last week by the Government, &quot;mismanagement&quot; of public finances and calling for coherent Fianna Fail-type economic and financial policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Government has always been prepared to listen to constructive advice and criticism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Coveney said. &quot;However, there is nothing constructive in describing the decisions taken last week as panic measures, reflecting imprudence in planning and lack of control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is that the Government, recognising that expenditure could run slightly ahead of the 2 per cent target for 1996, has taken prudent early action. This Government does not wish to engage in unfocused, ill-planned fiscal measures at the end of the year. In taking these actions now, dwell before the half-year stage, the Government is allowing Departments prepare balanced, planned and efficient programmes for 1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary concern was to sustain the momentum of growth and job creation over the longer term. The Government was committed to securing the strict limits being applied to the rise in current departmental spending which, for the first time ever, had been set out in A Government For Renewal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 6 per cent in 1995 and 2 per cent in real terms in 1996 and 1997, these limits were set well below the levels of increases which occurred over recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An important aspect of the process was the need to secure further improvements in the efficiency of the delivery of public services.  That was the focus of the Strategic Management Initiative which had been formulated in the Department of Finance to release the maximum potential of a motivated staff, Mr Coveney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary indications were that spending in 1996, if unchecked, could grow a little faster than the 2 per cent real limit. &quot;Ministers have, accordingly been asked to review their existing policies and expenditures so as to ensure that the best possible value can be secured within the spending target.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff numbers would be held at levels prevailing on June 9th last.  That did not materially affect Garda or De fence Forces numbers, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Castlerea prison project had been planned before the peace process and it was prudent to defer it. It was hoped that the continued peace in Northern Ireland would allow for a large number of gardai currently on the Border to be redeployed to areas of greatest need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Exchequer could not afford to allow public service numbers to continue rising at 3,500 a year, as had happened since 1990. It was anticipated that numbers would rise by an additional 3,600 by the end of 1995 unless action was taken to stabilise growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers employed across the education sector had increased by almost 5,700 since 1990 and education accounted for 27 per cent of public service employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health sector employment was just under 62,000 at the start of 1987. This was reduced to 55,300 two years later. By the end of this year there would be 66,000 in the &quot;health service, the Minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Eric Byrne (DL, Dublin South Central) said the curbs announced by the Government were prudent. Spending curbs now would ensure that vulnerable sectors of society would not suffer the financial backlash down the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, accused the Government of having no consistency, no firm sense of direction and no coherent leadership. &quot;Fine Gael/Labour governments were always bad for the economy. It is turning out no different this time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stop-go economic policies, in place of the sound and steady progress made under Fianna Fail governments of the last eight years, were the last thing the country needed, Mr Ahern said. The parties of the Left suffered from the fallacy that increased expenditure, taxation and borrowing were, in general, a good thing, and that their natural constituencies gained more from public spending than from reduced taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government had taken off the brakes in a number of areas. It had shown no restraint whatever in bringing in an unprecedented number of programme managers and special advisers from the outside, instead of using the resources available within the public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had been a 300 per cent increase in information and public relations services for the Taoiseach, and a 30 per cent increase in the cost of administering the office of the Tanaiste, including a trebling of the travel allocation, setting a very bad example. That office was totally unnecessary, and one which no previous Tanaiste ever needed, Mr Ahern said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government had adopted a totally lopsided approach to social welfare expenditure, with the Minister for Social Welfare, Mr De Rossa, concentrating all his resources on a couple of areas, awarding a minimal increase to the old and the unemployed without families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free third-level education was announced, based on defective costings, and creating serious new anomalies, said Mr Ahern. But while large increases were allocated to some areas, other priorities suffered, notably county roads and the community employment scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said last week's &quot;mini-Budget&quot; was clearly felt to be necessary to reassure markets. But if the State's financial affairs had been managed properly in the first place, it would not have been needed.  Public service embargos were inflexible instruments, which meant that certain areas could be deprived of necessary staff, while others remained overmanned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fianna Fail spokesman on finance, Mr Charlie McCreevy, said the recent OECD report had confirmed and legitimised all the recent statements made by his party on the downturn in the control of the level of public spending. There had been more than a 10 per cent increase in expenditure this year over last year, when the tax amnesty was excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever Fianna Fail's critics might say, any independent minded person would have to agree that the FF-led administrations since 1987 had proved to be very successful in turning the economy around from the disastrous situation of the mid-1980s, Mr McCreevy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it that the Minister for Finance and the whole Government had been asleep for the past six months and needed the OECD to tell them what opposition politicians had been stating, what independent analysts and commentators had been constantly repeating, and the world and its mother had been shouting from the rooftops?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, Mr McCreevy said, it might be slightly true of politicians the world over, but those in Ireland appeared hell bent in always setting themselves against the lessons of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debate on the motion continues this evening.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IARNROD Eireann has failed to offer an adequate explanation on why the taxpayer must fund 50 per cent of the cost of every mainline rail trip made in Ireland each year, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iarnrod Eireann will be seeking a subvention of Pounds 680 million from the Exchequer for 1994-1999, but the company has failed to show it would be money well spent, the committee found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the committee, Mrs Liam Kavanagh, said the inadequacy of the ease made for this financial support meant there had to be a comprehensive review of railway policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a unanimous report published yesterday, the committee called on the Minister for Transport, Mr Lowry, to begin that process by preparing a Green Paper on the future funding of railways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money being sought by Iarnrod Eireann was nearly four times the equity investment of Pounds 175 million and almost double the combined cost of the Western Parkway, the Northern Cross the Southern Cross, the downstream crossing of the river Lee and the by-passes of Athlone, Dundalk Mullingar and Balbriggan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the equivalent of nearly Pounds 200 from each citizen, Mr Kavanagh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee attributed failure to justify such a subvention not alone to Iarnrod Eireann's management but to the parent company, CIE, to the Departments of Finance, and Transport, Energy and Communications, and to successive ministers and governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report accepts that the question of value from railway expenditure is not just a matter of Iarnrod Eireann's financial performance. &quot;Wider economic and social issues must be included.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kavanagh said that the committee had not come down on a Beeching-style solution to the railway problems, which saw the wholesale closure of branch networks in Britain in the 1960s.  Although he understood that the DART lost money, Mr Kavanagh added, he welcomed the promised extension of the service to Greystones and its catchment area. This would mean a further 20,000 potential customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that Iarnrod Eireann's short-term priority should be profitability. That required a change in the company's operations with the adoption of a strong commercial focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A breakdown of management staff by professional qualification showed a strong engineering bias within the company, with relatively few managers having professional business or marketing qualifications, the report found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New and different skills in the commercial, marketing and cost control areas should be fostered and encouraged ...&quot;, the report recommends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern is expressed at a lack of coherence in public policy towards the roads and the railways. The report expresses concern at &quot;the lack of co-operation and consultation between the organisations involved in resource allocation for land transport&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kavanagh said Mr Lowry's policy review should consider making a single department responsible for roads and railways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AER Rianta has an open mind on whether Dublin's second airport should be located near the present one or at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, as suggested last month by Ryanair, the chief executive of the airports' authority, Mr Derek Keogh, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Keogh, who was appearing before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, added that Aer Rianta was &quot;somewhat in the dark&quot; about the Ryanair proposal. All they had seen was a brochure &quot;which doesn't contain a huge amount of information on which we could base views&quot;. There would have to be a serious process of examination of where the second airport should be rather than proceeding &quot;in a sound-bite way&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Keogh said experience elsewhere suggested the interests of airlines and airports were better served by developing at existing sites. The need for a new airport in Dublin was not all that pressing, Mr Keogh told the committee. Current facilities could cope with the current throughput of seven million passengers annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr John Ryan (Lab) asked Mr Keogh about claims by Ryanair that charges at Dublin Airport were excessive. &quot;We don't want to be involved in controversy with any of our customers,&quot; Mr Keogh replied, &quot;and Ryanair is a very valuable customer.&quot; However he went on, Aer Rianta would charge Ryanair Pounds 2 per passenger on a single Dublin-Birmingham journey. &quot;It's hard to believe that any airport could be 10 times cheaper than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Frank Fahey (FF) asked Mr Keogh if it would not be good for the country if Ryanair could compete with Aer Rianta's monopoly and offer Pounds 80 fares to Europe out of Baldonnel. Mr Keogh replied that, if Ryanair were to offer new services to Europe from Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta's discount arrangements would mean they would pay Pounds 1 per single journey, including air navigation charges. Ms Frances Fitzgerald (FG) asked what the implications for Aer Rianta would be if as proposed by the European Commission, duty free sales were ended within the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implications would be enormous, said Mr Keogh, for airport, airlines and car ferries. That was why Aer Rianta had become involved in diversification abroad, to earn profits to compensate for the possible loss of duty free at the end of June 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Mr Keogh added, Aer Rianta was fighting hard to have the Commission change its mind.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RESIDENTS of the controversial Clonmannon retirement village in Co Wicklow have decided not to run a candidate in the June 29th by-election in the constituency. A statement yesterday said the decision had been made in the light of assurances from Government and opposition parties in the by-election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents, aged between 70 and 88 years, have been in dispute with the management of the village for the past two years over the standard and cost of services provided. The Minister of State for Commerce, Science and Technology, Mr Pat Rabbitte, has said he is seeking legal advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fianna Fail candidate Senator Dick Roche, said yesterday he was &quot;appalled and flabbergasted&quot; by the Government's decision to take 25 top-ranking civil servants to Tinakilly House &quot;to discuss ways of axing lower-grade public service jobs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;The jaunt to Co Wicklow's only four-star hotel will set the taxpayer back over Pounds 300 for each of the Departmental bigwig's staying there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Left candidate, Dr John McManus, has accused Fianna Fail of &quot;weather-vane politics&quot; over the economy. He said that the Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, had been warning &quot;on an almost weekly basis&quot; about excessive public spending, but when &quot;prudent curbs&quot; were announced Mr Ahern had promptly accused the Government of panic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposing the proposed &quot;megadump&quot; at Coolbeg, Co Wicklow, the Independent candidate, Ms Susan Philips, called for legislation to reduce waste, a national plan for recycling and a national domestic waste incinerator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Frank Hayes, standing for the Workers' Party, said Wicklow was a neglected county. &quot;Nothing has been done because the Government and the present opposition in the Dail are a cosy club, indeed almost a family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Taoiseach, Mr Bruton, has denied that the Minister for Justice, Ms Owen, threatened to resign last Thursday because of the severity of public spending cuts in her Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, that she certainly could take it that no member of the Cabinet had offered their resignation last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ms Owen refused to deny a weekend newspaper report that she had offered to resign. Ms Owen was in Bucharest on Tuesday of last week when the Cabinet considered cuts amounting to Pounds 77 million this year. The details were drawn up by the Cabinet's sub-committee on budgetary strategy on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that Ms Owen took the view that the Department of Justice was bearing a disproportionate share of the cuts by being asked to cancel the Castlerea prison and new women's prison projects.  She also felt that recruitment to the Garda Siochana could be severely restricted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Owen later succeeded in having the Castlerea and women's prison projects postponed and secured agreement that the Garda would retain its current level this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GERMANY's ruling Christian Democrats unleashed the opening volley yesterday in a battle to set the agenda for next year's InterGovernmental Conference. The party called on the European Union to introduce majority voting for all joint foreign policy decisions which do not involve military action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launching two discussion papers at a press conference in Berlin, the party's parliamentary leader, Mr Wolfgang Schauble said that developing a coherent and effective joint foreign policy framework was one of the most important challenges facing the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The task of the Inter-Governmental Conference is to achieve the balance between political and economic integration which Maastricht failed to achieve,&quot; he said, adding that Germany remained firm in its support for a single European currency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tone of the new papers is much less abrasive than that of last year's CDU document which spoke of the creation of a &quot;hard core&quot; of countries around France and Germany to press ahead with closer integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Schauble stressed that yesterday's papers have the full support both of the Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, and the Finance Minister, Mr Theo Waigel, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign policy paper identifies the current decision-making process, where a single member state can veto any proposal as the main obstacle in the way of an effective EU foreign and security policy. It proposes a system of qualified majority voting for most foreign policy decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decisions involving military action would be decided in such a way that a minority of states could not prevent the majority from taking action, but that no individual state-should be obliged to take part against its will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper calls for the EU to play a more significant defence rote than hitherto, proposing the merging of the EU with the Western European Union and urging neutral member states, including Ireland, to join NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Territorial integrity is protected for most member states through collective membership of NATO. The alliance also offers indirect protection to non-members. To achieve the same security policy status for every member of the European Union, it is desirable, that all EU members should also be members of NATO,&quot; the paper says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Schauble has often repeated his belief that EU neutrals should be obliged to join NATO but, when pressed yesterday he insisted that it was no more than a suggestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr Karl Lamers, the CDU foreign policy spokesman, was one of the paper's authors, he was conspicuously silent during yesterday's launching. Mr Lamers, who is among the more enthusiastic European integrationists in his party would like to see the EU appoint a secretary general to co-ordinate foreign policy. But the paper stops short of suggesting this, simply calling for a permanent foreign policy body to be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Schauble dominated the launching but he made a point of introducing the CSU parliamentary leader, Mr Michael Glos, who drew attention to the antifederalist tone of some passages, particularly concerning the principle of subsidiarity which allows decisions to be made at the lowest practical level. &quot;People want the EU to take care of the big decisions but they don't want it interfering in the tiny details of their lives.&quot; Mr Glos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German demands for more effective defence co-operation in Europe look less convincing in the light of a row in Bonn about the deployment of Bundeswehr Tornado fighter jets to Bosnia. The cabinet put off a decision yesterday after a resolution by the opposition Social Democrats against the move. The government insists it can push the measure through without opposition support but with a Bundestag majority of just 10 votes, nobody is banking on it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By VINCENT BROWNE</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Pg. 14</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1080 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN this column last week I wrote about the appalling conditions that prep ail in Mountjoy foul-smelling insanitary conditions scandalously inadequate drug treatment facilities such as to undo much of the rehabilitative work done by agencies outside the prison a hopelessly insufficient prison welfare officer system the failure to provide the hare essentials for educational facilities vast overcrowding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I singled out for special comment the medical conditions in the jail two doctors attend the main jail for an average of three hours a week the average duration of a visit to one of these doctors is less than two minutes per patient no individual medical records are kept on prisoners there is a high incidence of AIDS and HIV in the prison, but it is not known to what extent there are several prisoners in Mountjoy at any given time who are gravely mentally ill, but because of long waiting lists for the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum nothing is done about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant aspect of this is that these conditions have prevailed for years in Mountjoy. The reports of the visiting committee have highlighted these year after year, and yet successive Ministers for Justice have done nothing or virtually nothing about them. In my opinion, this constitutes an abuse of the 5,000 or so prisoners who go through Mountjoy in any one year an abuse that must be regarded as deliberate on the part of these successive Ministers for Justice, as well as the Department of Justice itself.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although Nora Owen has been Minister for Justice for just six months, she, too, must share in this indictment because she has done nothing in these six months to deal with the inhuman and demeaning facilities that prevail in Mountjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in fact the case against Nora Owen is now more grave than I portrayed last week, for in the meantime she has been talking about conditions in Mountjoy and what she proposes to do about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday she told the Dail that all prisoners in Irish prisons &quot;have access to a full range of counselling and psychological services&quot; - She said that these services were provided by doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;full range of counselling and psychological services&quot; provided by doctors in Mountjoy, when these doctors spend less than two minutes with prison patients per visit? When there are no individual medical files? When gravely mentally ill patients are allowed reside in Mountjoy for months on end with no specialist care?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the appalling drug problem in the prison, a problem that spills outside the prison and, as the most recent report of the visiting committee notes, undoes the work of outside agencies, all she could say about the drug treatment programme was that she was &quot;anxious&quot; to introduce a methadone-based treatment programme. She said this would &quot;probably&quot; be done from the end of the current year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is incomprehensible that this was not done within a month of her becoming Minister, but that all she can now say is that she is &quot;anxious&quot; that this be done, &quot;probably&quot; in a further six months' time, is mind-boggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it would be wrong to suggest that Nora Owen proposes to do nothing about the drugs problem in the short term. And while she will not commit herself to lifting a finger to end the abuse of prisoners through the inadequacy of sanitation, medical, psychiatric and drug treatment facilities, she proposes to extend a procedure that, perhaps more than anything else, humiliates and degrades prisoners, that is, strip searching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This involves a full-body inspection of prisoners, including the anus and, in the case of female prisoners, inspection of the vagina as well. Surely no circumstances could ever justify the degradation of other human beings in this way not state security, not the integrity of the prison system, nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT suppose this position is too absolutist and that there are some extreme circumstances where, however degrading, strip searching is unavoidable? Then surely minimum requirements for the justification of such degradation would be firstly, that the scale of the evil being counteracted was such as to justify such measures and secondly, that everything else had been done otherwise to counteract such evil, and this &quot;everything&quot; had proved unavailing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is outlandish to suggest that the evil of drugs in Mountjoy is such as to justify such degradation, but we don't have to push this point too hard in these circumstances. What is incontrovertible is that everything has not been done otherwise to counteract this evil.  In fact, damn all has been done and the person now responsible for this is the very person now proposing the further degradation of the prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put it in other words, prisoners are to be humiliated and degraded because Nora Owen has done nothing more than feel &quot;anxious&quot; about introducing elementary drug treatment programmes and not even to feel &quot;anxious&quot; about the scandalous inadequacy of the medical and other facilities in Mountjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like her predecessor Maire Geoghan-Quinn, she is a sensible, caring, humane person. I write this, not in an offhand way, but because I know it to be true. For instance, without any publicity, certainly none generated by herself, she spent over a month during last summer in Africa working for Concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why now does she ignore the appalling conditions that prevail in Mountjoy and propose the extension of a procedure that is so outrageous, in terms of the degradation it inflicts gratuitously on others. And, yes, I use the word &quot;gratuitously&quot; deliberately because it is gratuitous, given the failure to introduce elementary and urgent reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be something about the culture of the Department of Justice that transforms otherwise kind, considerate and liberal human beings into Ministers who could neglect the current debasement of so many people and then propose their further degradation. And remember, Ms Owen is also now in favour of putting even more people (this time innocent people) into these conditions, through a curtailment of the right to bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite simply, the Department, of Justice has shown over the last 30 years that it is unfit to run the prison system. One of the key recommendations of the Whitaker report of 20 years ago should now be implemented the establishment of a prisons board, which would run the country's prisons, away from the baleful influence of the Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir, - The recent campaign by the Irish Research Scientists Association (IRSA) for increased levels of research funding in third level institutions is laudable and is generally deserving of support.  Regrettably, however, one of the main areas of emphasis in the IRSA campaign has been the notion of &quot;basic&quot; research, an activity generally understood to mean the search for knowledge, not merely as a means to an end, but as an end in itself. It appears to me, as an engineer and not a &quot;pure&quot; scientist, that the emphasis on the need for basic research is ultimately damaging to the case for increased funding, as it serves to enhance both the political and public perception of academics as residents of ivory towers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To illustrate, let me give an exam plc from my own discipline.  Over the last 50 years, a major focus of research in chemical engineering has been the prediction of the physical and thermodynamic properties of complex liquid mixtures. The results of this work play an important part in the design and safe operation of chemical plants. While the motivation for doing this research is essentially of an economic nature, the methods used are basic following the same rigorous approach as employed by &quot;pure&quot; scientists. In consequence, chemical engineers have made major contributions to the field of statistical thermodynamics, an area of study which most physical and chemical scientists would consider to be &quot;basic&quot;. Therefore, the motivation for studying a problem, and the fact that it arises in a technological (&quot;applied&quot;) context, do not necessarily affect the process by which the problem is studied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other examples of the apparently &quot;applied&quot; motivation for researching problems and the &quot;basic&quot; methods employed to study those problems, can be found in each of the branches of engineering. Given the significant presence of chemical, pharmaceutical, food and electronics companies in Ireland, it would be ironic to think that the present emphasis by the IRSA on &quot;basic&quot; research, might inadvertently lead to a further reduction in funding opportunities for those very people (i.e., engineers) who are most likely to conduct economically relevant research. I would appeal to the IRSA, therefore, to reconsider its emphasis on the term &quot;basic&quot; but to continue to stress the need for the State to adequately fund high quality research in all disciplines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last autumn, the debate on European integration was galvanised by a radical paper from the Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union coalition partners in the German government. It proposed that integration should proceed on the basis of a hard core of committed and able member-states and a varying. participation of those which were less so and it named states such as Italy and Spain among the second group. Yesterday, in a further contribution to the preparatory debate on next year's European Union conference to revise the Maastricht Treaty, the same two parties proposed that in foreign policy and defence matters votes should be taken on a majority, basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this occasion, however, the tone is less, devisive and more pitched at a realistic evaluation of what can command support from other member-states, going into the negotiations. But the proposals are backed by Dr Helmut Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, the two most senior cabinet members. They reflect one of the central concerns of the German government to ensure that economic and monetary union is backed, by a political union credible enough to persuade the German electorate to merge the deutschmark into a common currency. Germany's coming to terms with its restored sovereignty is expressed systematically in the language of greater European integration this suits its own interests, but is intended to guarantee that it is pursuing partnership not hegemony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along these lines the paper published yesterday distinguishes between foreign policy joint actions that have no military component, in which majority voting. would apply and those in which there would be a military involvement, where &quot;the majority should not be prevented from acting in common but that no country should be forced to take part in an action against its will&quot;. This is a flexible formula, which could well appeal to a wider group of states. The stress is on opting in rather than out. It could, therefore, accommodate states that were not willing for policy reasons, or by virtue of their neutral or post-neutral status, to join a formal alliance structure or to be bound by majority decision in this most sovereign of state functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Ireland's point of view two major issues arise from these proposals by the governing parties in the most powerful and influential EU member-state. First of all their determination to see a stronger and more coherent foreign and security policy develop is clear it should, they believe, be crowned by an eventual merger of the EU, the Western European Union and NATO. Given the similar determination of most other member-states, this initiative underlines the importance of the emerging debate on Ireland's military neutrality in this new setting. Secondly, however, the opting in formula, is obviously intended to overcome inflexibilities arising from varying commitment to security policies. But a systematic opting out would expose, a state pursuing such a course to marginalisation within the EU, which would affect other central interests. We will be hearing a lot more about these difficult choices as the debate, and then the negotiations, proceed over the next couple of years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PRESIDENT Clinton last night booked five minutes of national television time in a surprise move to announce a plan to balance the US budget in 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A White House spokesman, Mr Michael McCurry, directly linked the initiative to the summit of leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations, which opens tomorrow in Halifax, Nova Scotia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that it was also designed to begin a process of reconciliation with Republican plans to balance the budget in seven years. If this was presented in its present form to the White House as planned in September, the President would have to veto it, causing a &quot;budgetary train wreck&quot;, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are at a moment in which the world is looking to the United States for economic leadership and the President has found in his previous two G7 summits that his commitment to deficit reduction and to fiscal discipline has been warmly received by the other leaders of the industrialised world,&quot; Mr McCurry told a group of European journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vice president, Mr Al Gore, telephoned the three major television networks, CBS ABC and NBC to ask that they cover the prime time announcement live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McCurry said the president felt the seven year period would have distorting effects on the US economy and increase unemployment.  The president believed that within a decade it was possible to balance the budget consistent with his priorities and address what he saw as the &quot;negative consequences&quot; of the Republicans' proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the president hopes to avoid a congressional impasse over competing budget proposals that would jeopardise spending plans at the end of the fiscal year, September 30th. &quot;The path we're on now would literally shut this country down,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reforming financial institutions to cope with the demands of an increasingly global marketplace will top the agenda when the G7 leaders meet in Halifax, the third which will he attended by President Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dollar rallied yesterday afternoon on European foreign exchanges on the news that President Clinton would present a Budget plan aimed at balancing the US budget in 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier the US currency had fallen on news that the US Consumer Price Index rose only slightly in May. This could give the Federal Reserve some latitude to lower key short-term interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dollar traded at 1.3968 deutschemarks before the figures were published, down from DM1.3976 just after the US markets opened. On Monday the dollar closed at DM1.4035.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pound ended the day slightly weaker against the dollar at $ 1.627, compared to Monday's close of $ 1.630. It was almost unchanged against sterling and the deutschemark at Pounds 1.02 sterling and 2.24 marks. Analysts said the market did not want to risk being short of dollars when President Clinton gave his speech at 2.00 a.m. this morning Irish time, as European markets will be closed then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US retail sales in May rose per cent although experts had expected at least per cent. The actual figure tending to confirm the US economic slowdown, high-lighted prospects that the Federal Reser might cut interest rates, which helped US bond markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears of lower interest rates initially weakened the dollar.  However, analyst commented that if the rally staged by US treasury bonds continues, it should bring capital into the United States, a fact that could take the dollar up to around DM1.45 toward the end of summer and to DM1.60 at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IWP, the firelighter to aftershave group, is prepared to spend up to Pounds 25 million this year on acquisitions. The industrial holding company is keen to expand its core personal-care products business and its label making division, according to chief executive, Mr Joe Moran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IWP yesterday unveiled 1994 results which showed a major contribution from Lavendaal Beheer, the Dutch cosmetics, toiletries and household products group bought for Pounds 51.2 million at the end of 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavendaal accounted for 40 per cent of the groups operating profits of Pounds 21 million, said Mr Moran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profits before tax were Pounds 16.6 million, an increase of 11 per cent, and included a Pounds 2.4 million exceptional charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This related to the disposal of the groups telecommunications subsidiary, Special Telephone Systems, and also of William Freeman, a hot water bottle manufacturer. Both companies were located in England and losing Pounds 400,000 a year between them explained Mr Moran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every company in the group is now profitable and turnover last year rose 23.7 per cent to Pounds 150 million, added Mr Moran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's priority is now to strengthen its personal care and labelling divisions through acquisition, he said. The personal care division performed well but is only a small part of the group and another acquisition in this area is needed to make it a more substantial unit, he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly the label division is doing well but another company in this area will have to be bought if significant expansion is to be achieved, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard for label companies to break into export markets as manufacturers prefer dealing with local label makers, explained Mr Moran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure of a maximum expenditure on acquisitions of Pounds 25 million was based on the principle of not letting the group's interest cover fall below six times earnings from its present level of 11.2 times, said Mr Moran. However, the group could spend more than this through the use of instruments such as preference shares, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margins in the core household products and personal care division increased slightly from 18 per cent to 18.6 per cent. However, margins in the other major division, packaging, fell from 10.4 per cent to 9.2 per cent, due to increased raw material prices that could not be passed onto customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IWP is hopeful of maintaining&quot; margins in the present year, but the company sees little opportunity for an improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continental Europe is now the group's biggest market, with Pounds 70 million of sales there. After that is Britain with sales of Pounds 49 million followed by Pounds 27 million in Ireland and Pounds 4 million in the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earnings per share were 36.1p, an increase of 12.1 per cent. The dividend has been increased 10 per cent to 8.8p per share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Moran said that he was optimistic that the group's share price performance would improve. He pointed to the impending Pounds 220 million sterling flotation of McBrides, the largest private label household products manufacturer in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flotation would help further establish the credibility of the sector in the eyes of investors, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the basis of the McBride flotation price, IWP should be trading at a PE of 12.7, rather than its current level of 11, believes Mr Moran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even allowing for the discount usually seen for smaller Irish companies some improvement should be expected, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE CONSTRUCTION industry is set to outperform the economy as a whole this year, but some sectors, such as civil engineering are still very patchy, the industry's representative body has forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also evidence that the housebuilding sector which began the year very strongly is now beginning to taper off, according to the Construction Industry Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employment in the industry will be up 8,000 by the end of the year, bringing the total to 87,000 in the site-based sector. The number reaches 120,000 when upstream activity among the professions, material manufacturers and suppliers are included.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction Industry Federation (CIE) director general, Mr Liam Kelleher, said last night that construction investment would grow by 8 per cent this year, compared to the economy's expected growth rate of 5.75 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said by the end of the year the construction sector would still lag 20 per cent behind the performance of the economy as a whole since the mid-1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the civil engineering sector was the weakest sector, in terms of profitability, at present. Despite the impact of EU supported programmes, volumes will only increase by 12 per cent this year compared to last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CIF forecasts that the sanitary services sector will show a volume decline of 9 per cent and the allocation for national roads is up only 2 per cent in volume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an impression out there that the construction industry is doing very well, thank you,&quot; Mr Kelleher said. &quot;It is doing alright, but not anything like it needs to in terms of generating resources for reinvestment and gaining decent margins on turnover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelleher said activities had increased, but margins had not.  The period 1991-1994 had left a lot of overcapacity in the industry.  &quot;Even now, the industry is only operating at 60-70 per cent of capacity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regionally, he said, the recovery in investment was patchy. The greater Dublin region was performing strongly, but the rest of the country, including cities such as Galway and Cork were very weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year will see a welcome recovery in private investment, particularly in industrial, retail and tourism,&quot; the CIE forecasts.  It says this investment is set to increase by 9 per cent compared to last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The impact of public investment through the Public Capital Programme will be positive, with investment in building projects increasing by an estimated 17 per cent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BANK of Ireland's four executive directors each received average remuneration including pension contributions of just over Pounds 220,000 for the year to end March 1995, according to the company's annual report. The payments were just over one third the average paid to their AIB counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's total bill for the salaries, performance related bonuses, pension contributions and other benefits of the four executive directors, the governor and deputy governor rose by Pounds 159,000 to Pounds 1,182,000. But the 16 per cent rise partly reflected the addition of a fourth executive director, Mr Pat McDowell in 1994/95.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight non-executive directors received average annual payments of Pounds 22,000 each, most of which was accounted for by fees. The largest increase in directors' remuneration was a figure of Pounds 305,000 for performance related bonuses to the four executive directors, Mr Patrick Molloy, Mr Maurice Keane, Mr Patrick McDowell and Mr Michael Meagher, averaging more than Pounds 76,000 each. This compared to the total of Pounds 225,000 for the year to March 1994 which was shared between three executive directors. The figures compare with the average total payments of Pounds 600,000, including pension contributions, to each of AIB's five executive directors, a figure which was criticised by politicians and bank officials earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accounts showed record group pretax profits of Pounds 321.8 million, a 16 per cent increase on the 1993/94 figure of Pounds 227.5 million. The 1995 pre-tax figure was more than 10 times the 1991 figure. Earnings per share, at 44.2p were by 26 per cent and the group increased its total assets by 7.6 per cent to Pounds 18.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement group chief executive, Mr Patrick Molloy, said that the fall in loan losses, down from Pounds 59.8 million to Pounds 17.1 million had made a major contribution to the improved group profit.  In particular, the US operations in New Hampshire almost trebled their profit from Pounds 11.3 million to Pounds 33.5 million.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE major restructuring strategy at the Northern Foods group involving 3,500 job losses in Britain mainly in response to the turmoil in Britain's milk industry is being taken as a single financial &quot;hit&quot; in the form of Pounds 91.4 million sterling exceptional charges in its full year figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial costs of the restructuring played the major part in reducing the group's pre-tax profits from Pounds 157 million to only Pounds 16.4 million in the year to March 31st. But dividend payments totalling 8.8p per share are being maintained. Not affected by the cutbacks are Batchelors employing over 250 people in Dublin and Athy, the Dale Farm Dairies business employing over 450 people in Ballymena and Belfast, and the Green Isle frozen foods concern employing 700 people at sites in Galway, Kildare and Sligo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Foods is currently in the process of paying Pounds 24.7 million to lift its Green Isle stake from 36 to 79 per cent. The large British restructuring costs detailed by Northern Foods yesterday follow Monday's announcement by rivals Unigate of 1,500 job losses and Pounds 58 million exceptional charges mainly due to the cost of restructuring its dairy-related businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dairy operations of both groups have been hit by last autumn's abolition of the Milk Marketing Board and the succeeding milk pricing regime introduced by the newly-formed Milk Marque brokerage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Christopher Haskins, chairman, said the new milk selling system was unsatisfactory &quot;because of the arbitrary means by which the monopolistic Milk Marque can establish prices.&quot; The group, he said, had taken &quot;difficult but essential action&quot; to restructure its activities and reduce its cost base &quot;against a background of unprecedented change in both food distribution and raw material supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pounds 91.4 million financial costs detailed in yesterday's full year figures show Pounds 47.6 million cutback costs in the dairy sector, Pounds 29.7 million in convenience foods and Pounds 14.1 million in meat products. The cash cost of the restructuring is put at Pounds 50.1 million, with asset write-crowns accounting for the Pounds 41.3 million balance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DUBLIN continued to slip backwards but brokers claimed that sentiment had turned and progress could be expected to resume today. The rally in US and British bond markets on the back of yesterday's US economic data was given as the reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bond market's strength is expected to feed into equity markets, including Dublin, pushing prices ahead. Shares in Dublin closed well bid last night in expectation of an improvement today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial stocks have already started to show some encouraging signs. AIB was up 1p of 292p, while Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank both managed to hold their own at 343p and 52p respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish Permanent continues to weaken, dropping another 5p to 305p, but trading in the shares remains thin, according to brokers.  However, Monday's fall of 11p was the result of Pounds 700 000 worth of shares changing hands. One possibility being advanced by the market for the sell off is that an institutional holder has decided to sell out as the technically driven shortage of Irish Permanent stock is preventing it building a substantial stake at a realistic price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IWP reported strong, but unspectacular results for 1994 and announced that it was on the acquisition trail to the tune of Pounds 25 million. However, the results and bullish talk from the chief executive, Mr Joe Moran, to the effect, that the flotation of British household products group, McBride, would boost IWP's share price, had no impact. IWP was unchanged at 390p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greencore hit a new high of 448p on the back of last week's results. It is good news for executive directors Mr Kevin O'Sullivan and Mr Ben Power and the chief executive, Mr David Dilger, who have been granted 10-year options on Greencore shares at 447p. Mr O'Sullivan and Mr Power got options over 40,805 shares at the price, while Mr Dilger got options over 90,805 shares.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A LONDON equity market strangely reluctant to respond to the latest upsurge on Wall Street and in US Treasury bonds was buzzing with takeover speculation late yesterday. The latest rumours, which have been bubbling for around two weeks, indicated that a bid for one of the FTSE 100's leading stocks was being prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealers said the hot favourites were Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecoms group, and Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk of a bid for C &amp; W has been circulating for a number of months but has rarely been viewed as serious. More recently, the stories have been gaining credence and C &amp; W was easily the best performer in the FTSE 100 index yesterday, jumping more than 6 per cent, with market-makers noting rumours that the company was preparing to break itself up, to prevent a full-scale takeover from BT or AT &amp; T of the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close, the FTSE 100 index was 3.4 higher at 3348 a response described by strategists as disappointing in the face of Wall Street's strong showing. The latter was up around 25 points an hour and a half after London's close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was being pulled higher by a fresh advance by US Treasury bonds which were more than a point firmer in the wake of yet more evidence of a slowing US economy. The evidence came in the form of a smaller than expected increase in US retail sales, which rose 0.2 per cent in May against expectations of a 0.6 per cent increase and flat consumer prices in the same month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE Mid 250 index, which has trailed the senior index in recent sessions, did so again yesterday, closing 1.7 lower at 3657.6.  It was dragged down by poor performances from the property sectors.  The former was hit by a further slowdown in house sales while properties were damaged by poor results from British Land, Britain's third biggest property group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market-makers also pointed to increasing downside pressure on the composite insurers after CE Heath, the insurance broker confirmed the sustained downward pressure on commercial motor and fire insurance lines in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnover in equities remained disappointing, reaching 559.3 million shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 54 per cent of the total. Customer business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.17 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategists said the market was clearly unwilling to drive in either direction until a clear picture of the domestic economy emerged with the inflation and retail sales numbers tomorrow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate report, the labour department said its consumer price index rose a modest 0.3 per cent in May. Analysts said the retail sales decline suggested the economy may be slowing enough to warrant another rate decrease by the Federal Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to five on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE's composite index rose 2.62 to 288.18. The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 2.09 to 491.41.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LINFORD CHRISTIE was urged yesterday to think long and hard before quitting athletics at the end of the season, as he vowed to do in an emotional outburst on television on Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of people within athletics, including the former mile world record holder Steve Cram, the British Athletic Federation's spokesman, Tony Ward, and even his old rival Carl Lewis appealed to Christie not to end his career prematurely, although his long-time coach, Ron Roddan, said he thought Christie would stick by the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie belatedly appointed British team captain yesterday for the rest of the season after apparent confusion over procedure was also advised to &quot;stop reading the papers&quot; after blaming media pressure for his decision not to go on to defend the Olympic 100 metres title in Atlanta next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't take any more, I just can't,&quot; Christie said on ITV's Sport In Question pausing momentarily to recompose himself. &quot;I'm at the stage where I am so fed up I could walk away any day. When I get this season over that's it. I'm definitely not going to the Olympic Games.&quot; Roddan commented: &quot;I know he has talked of retiring before, but now I believe his mind is made up. He has been on about it for some time and I don't blame him&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie, however, has often changed his mind in the past he said he would quit in 1991 after the Tokyo world championships. Only 10 days ago, talking about retirement, he said his career would end &quot;when he threw his spikes into the crowd at Atlanta&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward believes the matter is still open to doubt. &quot;He was obviously highly charged on Monday night and personally I would prefer to wait until after the world championships to see if he sticks to his decision.&quot; Ward also cleared up the question of why no team captains were included when the European Cup sides were announced on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was mistakenly assumed that such nominations were the province of the selection committee, which did not have time to consider them on Sunday night. In fact, the posts are directly in the gift of the team management, and Christie was duly re-appointed, with a woman captain due to be named later this week. Nothing to do with the pay negotiations, then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie is currently under pressure both on and off the track. He has lost four of his five races this season, but what concerns him more is his continuing disagreement with the British Athletic Federation over how much appearance money he should be paid this season. He said on Monday that he would not race in the opening televised domestic meeting at Gateshead on July 2nd, and he placed doubt by implication on his appearance at subsequent British promotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federation, which still has to find sponsors for three of its five televised meetings this season, says it is having to economise as it seeks to bring in a new, graded payment structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie, who is due to race in Nuremburg tomorrow, thinks he is being unfairly singled out to take a pay cut. He cites an incident that took place last season as indication that the Federation has sufficient funds available claiming that Ian Stewart, head of the BAF promotions unit, offered him Pounds 100,000 to race Leroy Burrell in Britain shortly after the American had broken the 100 metres world record. Christie turned the suggestion down, preferring to meet Burrell later in the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis, responding to Christie's predicament said. &quot;The only thing I could say to Linford would be, whatever you do, do it because you want to do it. Don't let anyone run you out. If you do you will regret it for the rest of your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NOW THAT we are at the business end of the World Cup, with 28 matches gone and four to go, it is worth noting that the tournament has hardly been the bonanza, in playing or financial terms, it had been cracked up as being about to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rugby has seldom been other than fascinating and sometimes as in England's death-or-glory quarter-final against Australia last Sunday - unbearably exciting, the sort of thing that can turn even such a strong man as Jack Rowell lachrymose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as a group of matches you could not say last weekend's quarter-finals were that special as advertisements for an event that is billed here in South Africa as the greatest thing that has ever happened to rugby. Three of the weekend matches were sufficiently one-sided to blunt the hardest edge of competition that the World Cup would prefer but has not had often enough.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, we can reasonably hope for better - meaning closer - in the semi-finals, though if the bookmakers are to be believed we can forget an England-France final and instead prepare ourselves for South Africa v New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would be the re-establishment of a rugby order as old as this century, Springboks and All Blacks restored as the outstanding international teams and the rest, even England, struggling somewhere behind. Looked at dispassionately, there would be some justice in this eventuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a doleful thought that, heroically though they played to beat Australia, England had one idea in their heads: to stick the ball as high in the air as they could and wait for Wallaby mistakes.  This did not make victory and its manner any less exhilarating, but it was a perfect reflection of the supposedly pragmatic thinking of the home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact you could add France as well and turn home countries into five nations, because, although the French have an instinct and vision for the game to which their anglophone neighbours perennially aspire without achieving, they too have made their way through the World Cup by dint of honest toil, adding inspiration to perspiration only; when it becomes absolutely necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it comes to pragmatism, even this sturdy virtue was inadequate for Scotland and Ireland, though the Irish exit was tame by comparison with the Scots. Indeed, you could argue that what both sides took for pragmatism was in fact not pragmatic at all, because they lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this was more especially true of the Irish. You have to be fair and say that to arrive as no-hopers and go home as quarter-finalists was splendid and could not have happened to a nicer bunch of blokes, but to think that the way to beat France was to do nothing but kick for position was the sheerest folly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least, it was shown to be when the passion and fervour that characterised Ireland's pool matches against New Zealand and Wales went missing against the French. Subtract these qualifies and there was nothing left, not when as prime an asset like the wing Simon Geoghegan can be left isolated and utterly unused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the bane of British Isles rugby, and has been reinforced in this World Cup even times by England, that the modern game always has to be played by numbers, so that if you are in a certain part of the pitch you have to do a certain thing. Small Wonder David Campese and Tim Horan, Wallabies who have given boundless pleasure down the years, have come to the conclusion that playing rugby has become boring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt they would have been less disillusioned if Australia had beaten England last Saturday, but it is true that even the Wallabies have tended to kick rather than run and apart from the All Blacks, the most vivacious rugby by far has come from the Samoans, who like Australia, Ireland and Scotland have gone home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as the islanders are concerned it is as well they have, because although rugby badly needs countries of the second rank to force themselves into the first rank, it does not need the force to be applied as Samoa did to South Africa and quite properly earned Mike Umaga, the Wellington full-back, a 90-day suspension (reduced to 60 on appeal) for dangerous play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that the Springboks were ever in danger of losing the match as opposed toe their physical well-being. It is more critical than ever that they carry on winning, or at any rate reach the final, because the cash injection the South African economy was predicted to receive has proved largely illusory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus with visitors from overseas coming here in considerably fewer numbers than was fondly expected, it is largely down to the South Africans themselves to produce some sort of spin-off beyond the projected profit of Pounds 20 million on which Rugby World Cup Ltd has been congratulating itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One or two random disappointments make the point. A senior official at SABC, the host broadcaster, said this week that its losses could be &quot;horrendous&quot;. The hotel and car-hire industries have also been grievously disappointed, not only at the amount of World Cup business, but also at the deterrent effect the tournament has had on ordinary, non-rugby tourists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the final fortnight will make a difference; certainly it will if there is a last-minute influx of English visitors keen to; bask in the reflected glory of Will Carling's team. What a pity rugby's greatest Scot is here now only as a spectator, albeit for a television company, because if ever a player deserved to go all the way at a World Cup it is Gavin Hastings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember that penalty from short range that Hastings missed in the semi-final against England four years ago? Most people still do, yet Hastings has never let it become a monkey on his back and in all his years as an international he has been a figure of the most profound honour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Scotland's departure from the World Cup, and even then it was only after a noble battle against the All Blacks, comes Hastings's from playing rugby. Quarter-finals produce semi-finalists and we laud them for that achievement, but the 1995 quarter-finals also gave us a last glimpse of big Gav. Scotland may not see his like again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE THEORY is simple, the practice a different matter altogether. The only certainty is that Tony Underwood knows just how big a task he will have on his hands when Jonah &quot;The Whale&quot; Lomu rumbles towards him in Cape Town on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lomu, the 6ft 5ins, 19st Auckland-born man-mountain, has thundered on to the World Cup stage, gasps of wonder and astonishment trailing in his wake - along with fallen bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From his first game against Ireland, when he stormed through the thin green line as if it wasn't there, nobody has been able to take their eyes off him, with Lomu standing as a symbol of All Black power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand's opening try in the quarter-final against Scotland on Sunday summed up his image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he took the ball in midfield there was an audible sense of expectation from the Pretoria crowd, an anticipation which grew as Craig Joiner and Scott Hastings melted under his red-hot pace and power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In front, just inside the Scottish 22, stood Gavin Hastings, one of the great tacklers in international rugby, set perfectly, ready for the fray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no contest. Lomu just walked straight through him before flipping the ball up for Walter Little to touch down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hastings' verdict summed up the feelings of the world. &quot;There's no doubt about it,&quot; said the Scottish captain. &quot;He's a big bastard!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joiner admitted the job of nailing Lomu had been beyond him as well. &quot;What I wanted to do was to knock his arms out of the way first,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants to hand you off and he's so powerful that he can push you away, so you've got to knock them out of the way, go as low as possible and hang on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tried that, but there wasn't much I could do. I've never played against such a powerful opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former Wales and Lions wing John Bevan who man aged his fair share of crunching tackles after switching codes to join the paid ranks at Warrington - feels it is possible to stop Lomu, as long as you do it right from the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to stay close and get him before he gets underway,&quot; declared Bevan. &quot;He's a good player and you must respect him - but you simply mustn't let him get into his stride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bevan added: &quot;I notice that when he takes the crash-ball on the inside pass, he often spills it and is slow to get back on the wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A quick dart out to his wing will find him out as Joiner showed on Sunday. He beat Lomu on the inside and outside, so we don't know how his tackling is and how he deals with the kick-on himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easy to say front 6,000 miles away, not so easy to achieve from six feet, as even Lomu's New Zealand team-mate like Brewer ad milled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back row man prides himself on his tackling ability. But even he found Lomu too hot to handle when they came up against each other back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He came straight for me, I set myself and I really thought I was going to get him,&quot; said the Otago flanker, who matches Lomu for height if not bulk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOME students can spend over two months longer in second-level education than others simply because they go to a school with a longer academic year, according to a new study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, carried out by a Co Monaghan school principal, Mr Tony Kelly, has found variations of more than two weeks in the length of the academic year in different schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small, vocational schools tend to have the longest school year, while boarding schools tend to stay open fewer days, according to the research.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the academic year in most second-level schools corresponds to the 167 days recommended by the Department of Education, in practice this is taken as the maximum length of the school year, not the minimum the Department intends it to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An OECD report published last week claimed Ireland had one of the shortest school years in the western world and said this was partly to blame for below-average performance by Irish students in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department is due to issue a circular to all schools shortly which it hopes will clarify how long the school year is supposed to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most schools have an academic year of 167 days, this does not include 12 days which are set aside for the Leaving and Junior Certificate exams. In almost all schools, students who are not taking these exams in June are not required to attend school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Minister for Education, Ms Breathnach, wants teachers to work during at least some of this time by attending inservice training courses or performing other non-teaching activities. Her insistence that this be a prerequisite of any deal on early retirement is one of the main reasons why talks with the teacher unions on the issue have broken down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest study, which was carried out for the University of Hull in Britain, reveals large variations in the length of the school year in different sectors. The shortest year found was 160 days, and the longest 171 days. VEC schools with fewer than 400 pupils have longer school years, because staff and parent-teacher meetings in some counties are organised outside the regulation 167 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 14 per cent of schools work more than 167 days. The working week in vocational schools is about 27 to 28 hours in secondary schools, it is slightly longer, at 28 to 29 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly's study is based on a questionnaire sent to all 780 second-level schools in the State. Some 64 per cent of schools responded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN environmental row on the Waterford coastline is expected to be resolved shortly when the Minister for the Marine, Mr Barrett, rules against a shellfish development in Dungarvan harbour. Dungarvan Bay is an internationally important bird habitat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application to grow clams on the harbour's north shore is expected to be rejected by the Minister, after a long campaign by residents opposed to the project. The decision is expected to have implications for the cultivation of shellfish in environmentally-sensitive coastal areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dungarvan Bay is recognised as a bird habitat under the EU birds directive. Parts of the harbour have been designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) by the Office of Public Works on the basis that existing aquiculture activities are not incompatible with this. The bay has a significant oyster fishery on its south-west shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Department of the Marine is understood to be concerned about the environmental impact of any further shellfish development. In May, 1994, the promoters of the project, Waterford Clams Ltd, placed seed trolleys on Abbeyside beach without a licence.  Initial objections to the project by the OPW's national parks and wildlife service were withdrawn under political pressure, according to objectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bord Failte, Waterford County Council, Waterford Urban District Council and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy all expressed severe reservations, while a complaint was lodged with the European Commission by the Dungarvan Bay Amenity Protection Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association represents sailors, anglers, bird-watchers, divers and other residents concerned about the impact on the habitat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, Waterford County Council recommended that the Department of the Marine should reject the licence application by the promoters, given that the area was recognised as a valuable tourist amenity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While shellfish cultivation is regarded as environmentally &quot;benign&quot;, the issue concerned access to the beach. Clam cultivation involves rotovating a site, to clear it of predators before laying the clams under a mesh and ploughing them up at harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disturbance to the sediment can affect invertebrate fauna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feeding habitats of waterfowl, such as brent geese and turnstone, can also be disrupted by tractors which are used to transport bags and boxes. Areas of the inter-tidal zone are often cleared to facilitate the vehicles. Discarded nets can harm waterfowl and other marine life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An umbrella group formed to lobby for the project, the Dungarvan Clam Growers' Association, had claimed that between 400 and 500 jobs could be created through a &quot;properly developed aquaculture industry&quot; on the north shore of Dungarvan barb our. This figure was cut to 100 jobs in a letter to local politicians. The application lodged by Waterford Clams estimated the projected employment to be some five full-time and two part-time jobs in four years' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of the Marine, which consults regularly with the OPW on aquaculture developments in sensitive sites, says it is confident that shellfish cultivation need not be affected by the new SPA designations, which began with Dungarvan Bay, Tramore backstrand, Youghal harbour, Cork harbour, Castlemaine harbour, inner Galway Bay and Bannow Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last October, the BIM fish farming newsletter warned that SPAs would reduce the pace of shellfish farming development.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE economic history papers got a mixed reception from teachers this year, though there was general agreement that the papers, particularly at higher level, were an improvement on previous years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinary level paper was described as &quot;very fair&quot; by Des Cowman, ASTI subject representative and a teacher at Tramore CBS, Co Waterford. &quot;The vast majority of questions were good questions for that level and suitable.&quot; He did feel, he said, that there were &quot;a few peculiarities&quot;, such as the question that asked students if an illustration was a true reflection of the working standards of agricultural labourers in post's Famine Ireland - the picture; depicts a group of people doing nothing more active than sitting on a cart. In addition, a question on agrarian reforms in Russia from 1906-1910 was felt to be &quot;extraordinarily specialist&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was more critical of the higher level paper, which contained what he described as &quot;some very odd things&quot;. Question 11, which invited students; to compare the economic responses of Irish governments in the two World Wars, was problematic because, strictly speaking, there was no Irish government during the first World War.  In addition, he felt some of the questions were too abstract and were more suited to a third level examination. &quot;It has to be said it is much better than it was in previous years,&quot; Mr Cowman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consensus at Jobstown Community College, Tallaght, Dublin, where Mr Charlie Ferguson teaches, was that the papers were &quot;good&quot; at both levels and that preparation had paid off. &quot;The more favoured topics came up,&quot; Mr Ferguson said. Both ordinary and higher level students in the college raised a hearty cheer when questions on economic history, the early years of the Free State and the Industrial Revolution came up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One student, Daniel Keating, described higher level question seven, which required students to prove a negative proposition, as &quot;difficult to grasp&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A SECOND round of public spending cutbacks has been ruled out by the Tanaiste, Mr Spring, but next year's Budget will be &quot;tight&quot;. Speaking in Luxembourg last night, the Labour Party leader vigorously rejected reports that the Government spending curbs designed to save Pounds 77 million did not go far enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did acknowledge, however that the Government would need a degree of &quot;luck&quot; to keep the public finances in check next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Opposition plans to use tonight's Dail Private Members' Time to attack the Government for its &quot;mishandling of the economy&quot;, the Progressive Democrats leader, Ms Mary Harney, has claimed the coalition's spending policies are in disarray.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Quinn and the Taoiseach Mr Bruton, had issued contradictory explanations for their &quot;panic attack&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attending a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Mr Spring rejected reports that a further Pounds 70 million in cuts was in the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is total nonsense. It is without a shred of foundation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigning in Wicklow, the Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, attacked the Government's record on crime and said that while plans for the &quot;mini Budget&quot; had been afoot for six weeks, the Minister for Justice Ms Owen, had clearly not been informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sources close to the Minister denied a report that she had threatened to resign her portfolio in protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that she felt particularly aggrieved that specific high profile projects within her responsibility were named for postponement while other Ministers were asked to make across the board cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy, Mr Spring said in Luxembourg, was performing well but a number of once off payments, such as compensation for Hepatitis C victims and the Pounds 75 million EU fine on the beef industry were pretty unexpected demands on public spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wicklow, the Taoiseach, Mr Bruton, said the steps the Government was now taking would lay the foundation for a pro jobs budget in 1996 and 1997. This could only be done if expenditure was kept under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her statement, Ms Harney said that &quot;the high taxing, high spending policies of this Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left government have set the public finances of this country on an out of control spiral&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was deeply worrying that there appeared to be no overall strategy for addressing the underlying problems relating to public expenditure, debt and unemployment, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the OECD and the Central Bank report suggested that the Government should be cutting the national debt, not adding to it, and should be decreasing tax on work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, it now appears likely that whereas the Government may dispose of some non essential State assets, like the sale of its remaining stake in Irish Life, the proceeds will not go to easing the debt burden (if only by a fraction) but will be devoured by the insatiable black hole of Government expenditure,&quot; Ms Harney added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fianna Fail has tabled a motion for debate tonight which cites a range of examples of Government mismanagement, including the latest &quot;out of control&quot; public spending, panic decisions by the Minister for Finance and an ad hoc approach to planning. In Arklow last night, Mr Ahern said the announcement of a freeze in Garda recruitment and deferral of two new prisons could not have come at a worse time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like elsewhere, Wicklow had experienced the &quot;terrible brunt of thuggery, drugs, vandalism, attempted kidnapping, and general violence and crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing instances of recent crime, Mr Ahern said that 3,800 drug offences had been detected in the past year. In 1993 alone, there were over 30,000 robberies of property worth Pounds 25,500,000 - and only Pounds 2 million was retrieved, Mr Ahern said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A BRITISH Labour Party MP, Ms Kate Hoey, and the writer and former Irish Cabinet Minister, Dr Conor Cruise O'Briein, are, supporting the integrationist unionist candidate in the North Down Westminster by-election, Mr Robert McCartney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the UUP leader, Mr Jim Molyneaux, has warned that if Mr McCartney were elected it could damage the chances for peace in Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Hoey, MP for Vauxhall, who was born in Newtownabbey, Co Antrim, joined Mr McCartney on his canvass in Bangor, Co Down, yesterday morning. She is a leading advocate for Democracy Now, a pressure group campaigning for the Labour Party to accept members from Northern Ireland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from Mr McCartney's election headquarters said: &quot;Robert McCartney's vision of a new political land-scape and his call for an inclusive Union based on pluralism and social and economic politics commends itself to Kate Hoey, as an Ulsterwoman proud of her roots and anxious to make a strong case for Northern Ireland within the New Labour Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Cruise O'Brien is to join Mr McCartney on a canvassing trip today and will attend a press conference at which the candidate will launch a collection of his writings on the Northern political situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a UUP North Down constituency meeting at the weekend, Mr Molyneaux criticised Mr McCartney for refusing to take part in a BBC debate involving the eight candidates in the constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, the UUP leader referred to a pledge by Mr McCartney to light a fire that would sweep across Ulster and said: &quot;This is not only to betray what unionism represents, but a threat to set back by 10 years our chance of peace. I have sought for 25 years to quench fires of fear and distrust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a former Northern Ireland Minister, Mr Richard, Needham, has called for support, for Mr Stuart Sexton, the Conservative candidate in the North Down contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Needham said: &quot;North Down needs an MP who will follow in the footsteps of Sir James Kilfedder.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFTER MONTHS of inertia it appears that the slop-go Middle East peace process has moved into a higher gear. An opportune visit by the US Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, to the region at the weekend saw clear signals of important progress on several fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the timing of a visit to the region by the Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Spring, appears impeccable. The week-long tour which starts today, Mr Spring's first as foreign minister, will take in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, following largely in the tracks of Mr Christopher.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is being seen by Iveagh House as a crucial part of the preparations for Ireland's presidency of the EU next year and our membership of the EU's diplomatic arm from January 1st.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Spring's visit follows one by the German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, during which he pledged increased German and EU-support for water and regional economic projects designed to underpin the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two visits help underline the success of southern EU states in rebalancing the preoccupation of the union with the states of central and eastern Europe (CEECs). And they will help to prepare for the important EU Mediterranean summit planned for November in Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the union's eastern strategy, based on preparations for membership, the EU's focus in the south is towards assisting in the building of greater economic integration in the region and the eventual creation of a free trade area encompassing the Middle East, the Maghreb countries of north Africa, and the union. Only three of the 12 prospective partners in the Mediterranean are applicants for membership Cyprus, Malta, and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual partnership agreements with the rest, opening up markets and other forms of cooperation, are in the process of being negotiated Tunisia is ready to sign an agreement and Egypt would like to conclude its own before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco is involved in fraught discussions with the EU over fish, and Israel, whose basic package has been agreed, has been indulging in recent days in its own form of megaphone diplomacy over disputed elements of the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's negotiators were petty &quot;bureaucrats&quot;, the Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr MishaHarish, told the Financial Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel is demanding access as an observer to the EU's decision making committee on research and development. After all, one diplomat said, &quot;it is not as if we are not paying our own way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tel Aviv also wants to sign up to what are known as the Outward Processing Traffic accords to do with the exporting of textiles to Israel and then reimporting them in processed form under preferential tariffs and access to the EU public procurement markets. Mr Spring will certainly have his ears bent on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will also hear of the priorities of each of the countries for the Barcelona summit and may be able to report progress on reaching agreement on the unions five-year multi-billion aid package for the Mediterranean. A minimum figure of Pounds 2.8 billion is now likely to emerge, with the promise of further payments as resources permit and needs arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Tanaiste will be keen to reinforce the growing warmth of Ireland's bilateral relations with the region, particularly with Egypt and Israel, which recently opened an embassy in Dublin. The Egyptian Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Abdallah Fouad Hafez, points to the near doubling of Irish exports to Egypt between 1993 and 1994 from Pounds 84 million to Pounds 137 million largely beef and believes the visit will enhance the relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sees the Mediterranean conference, originally stemming from an Egyptian initiative as an important way of creating a sense &quot;that it is not a sea that separates us but a lake that brings us together&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing importance of the economic dimension of relations with the region is not, however likely to overshadow discussion on the newly invigorated peace process. And Ireland, with 600 troops in southern Lebanon, who the Tanaiste will visit, has a particular interest in the Syrian-Israeli detente.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Israel the Tanaiste will meet the Foreign Minister, Mr Shimon Peres, as well as the leader of the opposition Likud, Mr BenjaminNetanyahu, whose party is in the process of tearing itself apart. He will also visit the Holocaust memorial and have talks with the mayor of Jerusalem, Mr Ehud Olmert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Spring's visit culminates on Sunday with a midnight meeting in Gaza with the Chairman of the PLO and head off the Palestinian Interim Authority, Mr Yasser Arafat, followed early next morning by a visit to projects being supported by Ireland and the EU in the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Bosnian Serb leader, Dr Radovan Karadzic, indicated yesterday that the release of a fresh batch of detained UN military personnel could be imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will have news about the prisoners tomorrow, Dr Karadzic&quot; said as he entered a meeting of the executive of his Serbian Democratic Party preparing for a &quot;parliament&quot; meeting of the self styled Bosnian Serb state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assembly is due to meet tomorrow in the Bosnian Serb headquarters town of Pale outside Sarajevo to discuss the deteriorating Serb military situation across Bosnia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgrade the independent Beta news agency quoted an unnamed top Bosnian Serb official as saying a large group of peace keepers could be released today or tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serb official said the freedom of the remaining 52 UN troops and observers held hostage and the 92 still blockaded in their positions was being delayed by &quot;technical problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Luxembourg, the European Union's new mediator for former Yugoslavia, Mr Carl Bildt, said he was optimistic the remaining UN hostages would be released fairly soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take it for granted that (their release) will happen,&quot; be told reporters after meeting EU foreign ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention of the Serbian President, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, secured the release of 232 hostages seized after NATO air strikes on a Serb position near Sarajevo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French President, Mr Jacques Chirac, telephoned Mr Milosevic again on Sunday to ask him to secure the release of the last of the hostages and was assured they would be freed very soon, Mr Chirac's office said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serb official quoted by Beta did not deny that there were some &quot;political aspects&quot; slowing the release of hostages but refused to give any details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosnian Serbs are thought to be reluctant to hand Mr Milosevic further public relations victories with the West by releasing hostages through the offices of his state security chief, as happened on the occasion of the two previous releases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sarajevo a UN spokesman, Mr Alexander Ivanko, condemned as outrageous the continued detention of peacekeepers and the use of at least one as a human shield against new air raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand one of our UNMO's (military observers) is still being held at Jahorina radar station, which is an outrageous, act and we hope that they will be released as soon as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN mission has been paralysed by the Serb response to air strikes, with aid convoys halted and all flights into Sarajevo air port cancelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The first French troops in a rapid reaction force to protect beleaguered UN peacekeepers is due to land in Croatia today, the French Defence Ministry announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An infantry company equipped with armoured personnel carriers and a medical unit is to land in Split on the Adriatic coast in an operation code named Hermine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE owners of a glazing firm have won Britain's biggest lottery jackpot - and the estranged wife of one of them said yesterday she wanted her share of the Pounds 22.5 million prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm after half his cash. Our decree absolute has not come through yet so I am entitled to half,&quot; Ms Kim Creswell, estranged wife of one of the joint winners, Mr Mark Gardner, told the Sun newspaper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you ask me what I think of him now he has won the lottery, it is the same as before. He is a two faced bastard,&quot; the paper quoted her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winners are from St Leonard's on Sea, East Sussex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gardner refused to discuss allegations in the Sun that he had been thrown out by his former wife, Kim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would not comment, either, on an interview with his adoptive mother, Ms Irene Cresswell, in which she was quoted as saying: &quot;I hope he drinks himself to death with his money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was upset by some of the comments attributed to his ex wife and stepmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very sad some of the things that have been written about me.  If you went to Hastings and spoke to my real friends you would get a completely different story,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prize, which Mr Gardner shares with his business partner, Mr Paul Maddison, tops the record of Pounds 18 million won by an Asian factory worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Maddison said at a press conference they had opted to go public about the win because it was inevitable people would find out and they did not want to be constantly hounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Maddison was accompanied by his wife Ruth (40), a primary school teacher, Mr Gardner by his current partner, Ms Brenda McGill (39).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who previously held the lottery record has left his factory job in the northern town of Bradford and moved to a luxury, home in southern England, where he told the Sun: &quot;I still eat curries but now I can afford better ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man has changed his name by deed poll and obtained a legal order banning identification of his children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;OUR DESTINY is simplicity. I wouldn't be surprised if most of us end up living in quiet little countryside homes, possibly with a modem beeping away in the corner . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, I would be very surprised if anything resembling &quot;most of us&quot; in Ireland in the year 2020 enjoy such a lifestyle - though perhaps it depends on how you define &quot;us&quot; - but this contribution to the cutely titled Twenty Twenty Vision (RTE Radio One, Sunday) still made a pleasant antidote to the prevailing millennarianism. (It also offered consolation for those of us faced on Sunday evening with the unthinkable medium term future - Ireland may fail to qualify for the European Championship finals in England next year.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speaker was Gerard O'Neill of the Henley Centre, who was described by presenter Mary Mulvihill as &quot;Ireland's only professional futurist&quot;. Professional optimist more like. Here's another example: &quot;The future isn't predictable, but it is persuadable.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or how about O'Neill's comments on education? The Three Rs, it seems, must be replaced, if our children are to thrive, by the &quot;Three Cs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's see - competitiveness, connivance and, of course, computers?  Nope. &quot;Co operation, communication and creation&quot;. Really. You've got to like this guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you've got to like Mary Mulvihill, who in the 15 minutes of this week's first programme in her new series on &quot;the future&quot; showed again that she's got a definite knack for this popular science lark.  Yes, she employed a few of the common cliche's of what a changing society we've got journalism, e.g. &quot;Kids who have access to the Internet are driving in the last lane of the Information Superhighway.&quot; And why not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also demonstrated, a capacity for clever, thoughtful and unusual approaches - such as kicking off a series about prospects for the future with a blast from the past, interviewing a historian about the impact of technological change in Ireland in the 19th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even at this remove, the history of the revolutions in industry and agriculture here more than a century ago sounded far grimmer than, O'Neill's bucolic vision for our own future. New ploughs had catastrophic impact on farm employment. Creameries, bakeries and the meat processing industry diminished the economic role of women's work in the home. Jobs were taken away from rural areas and centralised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skills which had stood Irish people well for &quot;thousands of years&quot; were suddenly replaced by new categories: mechanisation, large scale transportation and bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resistance to such change seems to have been considerably more spirited than opposition, so far, to the &quot;Information Revolution&quot;. In the 1830s, Kilkenny farm labourers smashed their scythes. In Ulster, evangelical ministers called the new railways &quot;instruments of the devil&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Side by side with the futurists, this foray into history made for a promising start to the series. Mary Mulvihill tied her diverse historical and speculative material together impressively, with tireless good humour that complemented her evident genuine, unpretentious commitment to getting across big ideas in tidy packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind you, for tireless good humour there's no beating Mooney Goes Wild on One, (RTE Radio One, Saturday), which returned to the airwaves over the weekend. You could get tired listening, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenter Derek Mooney makes interest in and knowledge about nature and wildlife sound like the most amiably Irish of occupations, with celebrity panellists chatting about insects, Frankie Gavin on the telephone from Oughterard, Co Galway playing his very cool musical piece featuring drums, voice and corncrake, and a competition that invited listeners to ring in and Name That Birdsong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme seems to have no particular eco agenda to push - a friendly tut tut for a guest who admitted a previous interest in shooting was as political as Mooney got. It's just as well, perhaps, though it would be interesting to see how a bit of controversy would survive the zippy production values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mooney Goes Wild is great fun, probably the liveliest 45 minutes of RTE radio since the second half of Ireland v Portugal in April. Oh, that we could have more like both of them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT'S IT like being a mother in the House as well as a mother in the house? With the summer recess around the corner, we asked four women politicians to share something of their complicated lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an adopted child, becoming a mother herself was very important to Fianna Fail senator Marion McGennis. She has three children. Susan (18) is studying arts in Maynooth, Brian (17) is currently sitting the Leaving Cert, and Jean (13).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion retired from the civil service when she got married and spent the next 10 years at home with her three children. &quot;It was wonderful, atrocious. It was normal. I was quite content. It was my husband Brian who told me as nicely as possible that I was turning into a vegetable. I realised that when we were in company I was often very unaware of current affairs. Also, when people would say, 'we're not talking about nappies or kids tonight', I would say to myself why not, what's wrong with that?'&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her interest in public life began when Jean was a baby, through a social-studies course with creche provided. Marion joined Fianna Fail, and in the 1985 local elections she was asked to stand in the Mulhuddart ward in Blanchardstown, Co Dublin. &quot;I just about scraped in,&quot; she says, and then she had to decide how to manage the demands of her new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Afternoon council meetings three times a week began just when the children were coming home from school. Once a week the meeting went on until 9.30 p.m. I had a local clinic, people began telephoning and calling to the house, and it was all happening very quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mother had just retired and she took over my home. She did the cooking, looked after Jean, answered the phone. She took the constituency work very seriously, and would say now, mind you ring back that little girl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marion was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1992 general election, but entered the Seanad in February 1993 as a Taoiseach's nominee. She is still a local councillor. &quot;There is a council meeting every Monday. The Seanad sits on Wednesday and Thursday, so Tuesday is a good day. They could get fed on Tuesday. I hold clinics during the week and on Saturdays. On Saturday I do the house which can be very satisfying. In politics you sometimes feel you're achieving nothing, but when the bathroom has been cleaned, you notice the difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On Sundays I look at the omnibus edition of EastEnders, do a family dinner and basically flop. There can be a problem, Now when I have time, I want to play Mammy, I expect them to play kids, but they're busy elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARION McGennis is refreshingly open about the difficulties of combining home and career. &quot;My mother died in 1990, which raised childminding questions. Jean was adamant that she didn't want anyone in the house, so Brian and Jean came home from school together, and were on their own for an hour-and-a-half until Susan came home. My husband works shifts, he was often there my neighbours were available if there was any problem, and I was on the phone all the time. But people could have called me a bad mother, rearing latch-key kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son Brian said at one stage he wished he had an ordinary mother and I do appreciate kids do not like you to be different and they can be slagged. Sometimes you find them double-checking that you will be at a parent-teacher meeting. I tend to blame myself immediately if they get into any kind of scrape or difficulty. I feel guilty, I decide it's because they lack stability in their lives, and don't come home to a perfect mother and a cooked meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tidiness is a big issue. Last night I was home at 5.30 p.m. and started the dinner, had to go out, came in, had dinner, went out again. When I arrived home later I found things had not been cleared up after the meal, and as we speak, the place is still a mess. Brian, my husband, is very supportive, but lack of order doesn't bother him as much as it does me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she sees advantages in her dual role. &quot;The children are independent and open-minded, I hear it in their conversations with their friends about current affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE day I got elected I wondered how I could get out of it,&quot; says Therese Ahearn, calling her 1989 victory for Fine Gael in South Tipperary. &quot;I hoped I would make a respectable showing, but never really expected to get elected. My children then were aged two to 11, and my big problem was working out how on earth I would manage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had several advantages. One was that I was a schoolteacher and they were used to my going off to work. The second was that my husband, Liam, was always at base on the family farm, and that his mother also lives in a separate part of the house and could be called on if needed. I was lucky also being elected in June, the Dail didn't reconvene till the autumn, so I spent that summer putting arrangements in place. I had had no experience of parenting at a distance. I decided I would do whatever was needed to get the family right.&quot; She plumped for someone to come in every day to run the house and look after the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first term up in Dublin was very difficult. I was on the phone five or six times a day, though the job was so strange and absorbing that it took a lot of my concentration and stopped me worrying too much.&quot; Back home on Thursday night, she was plunged back into instant parenting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As mother you are the one that does the planning, the shopping, gets their hair cut, their clothes ready for the week. When I was home, they wanted me to read the stories, even do up their shoes.  Scott my youngest used to look at the Dail on television and say there's Mammy'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never felt guilty. I think it's an important role model to be another who works outside the home. Children are fantastic in the way they adjust to change and everything has worked out very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days life has a fairly organised routine. Her two eldest sons, Patrick (17) and Garret (16) are at boarding school, Liam (12) and Scott (eight) go to school locally. Therese does her constituency work from home in an office separate from the main house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scott was ill last year, I was on the phone hearing that the doctor was coming, that he may have to go to hospital. I was very anxious and got home as quick as I could. My sons are very good at sport, and I can never see them play because it's mid-week. I really miss that. It's not perfect&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROISIN Shortall has three daughters aged 14, 12 and seven, and was reluctant to allow me use their names in print: &quot;I think they are entitled to privacy. I'm very slow about doing this type of interview, and I wonder are you also going to talk to male politicians about how they juggle the conflicting demands of home and work?&quot;. Touche</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Labour backbencher representing Dublin North West, she was elected to the Dail in November 1992. Except for a five-year career break from teaching when her children were younger, she has worked outside the home for all her married life. The family system works through role sharing leaning towards role reversal - between herself and her husband, Seamus: &quot;Seamus has taken over the organisation of the children of the borne and that is a key point,&quot; she says. &quot;I depend totally on him for this. He is 75 per cent the parent and I am 25 per cent. I see the children for breakfast only from Monday through Thursday, as generally speaking once I leave in the morning, I am not home till 11 pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he does the cooking and shopping during the week? &quot;In theory we plan the menus together for the week, but it doesn't always happen in practice. It's Seamus who knows the children's friends, who feeds them when they come to play and drives them home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is key. Over the weekend she enjoys cooking, gardening, and day trips to the country with the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a backbencher she is deeply and unapologetically involved in constituency work through clinics, correspondence, phone calls and meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I represent an area with a very big level of unemployment, poverty, houing problems, and people who spend their lives in queues, trying to sort out welfare issues. I get up to 250 a week and the follow-up on all these takes time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish it were not so. I wish people - were sufficiently empowered to sort out their own problems. I wish they could go to their citizen's advice bureau and get the help they need. But this doesn't happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has recently paid for a part-time constituency secretary out of her own pocket. She says that as a public representative, she accepts she is public property - with the consequential impact on family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I regret the fact that by midweek I can have lost touch a bit with the children. I would ring them every evening, and I would often wish that I could spend more time with them. I think it's particularly hard on my seven-year-old who doesn't often have a bedtime story from Mum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm not guilty. I do what I do from conviction. You could say my family suffers a bit for the sake of the wider family of the community. For me, politics is not a career, but a vocation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KATHLEEN Lynch gets up at 6.45 a.m. on Tuesdays at her house in The Lough, Cork, and catches the 7.30 a.m train to Dublin. She comes home again on Thursday nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm met with a litany of complaints about the things I never organised before I left, like it was someone's birthday and they had no money for a present. I don't know what pocketmoney is for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen won the Cork North Central by-election in November last year. She still wonders will she ever come to terms with the loneliness involved in her new role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of her four children, Thomas (22), Eve (19), Ruth (17) and Valerie (16), the three girls still live at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen entered local politics 10 years ago, but was able to work from home by converting her sittingroom into her office. When it came to attending council meetings, there was no shortage of babysitters: &quot;I am the youngest of 11, many of my nieces are almost my own age. If I really had to, I'd take the kids with me and they could do their homework in the public gallery during the meeting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving her place of work to Dublin has not been so easy: &quot;People have said to me my children are reared now, and I should have no problem. I don't agree. I think this is the watching age, the age around which there can be far more dangers. I have someone now living in, someone who is not too doctrinaire, who has the same attitude as myself. I believe in few rules the less there are, the less will be broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back home at the weekend she works in the constituency on Friday and Saturday, and tries, sometimes unsuccessfully, to hold the line on Sunday. Her absence has thrown her husband Bernard's relationship with his daughters into sharp relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very difficult for him they can be very assertive. Fathers traditionally don't have as intense relationship with their children growing up as does a mother, so it can be difficult for them to know how to assess something. I say to him take it easy, it's not as bad as you think&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been crises over the past few months. My heart sinks when two of the children phone together, you know it's important, and you know there's only so much you can do at a distance. A friend of theirs died recently, and the mother of another friend died. They were very upset and vulnerable, and I wasn't able to be there for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a lonely life. I'm aware that I don't know some of their new friends, or what has happened. Things change very quickly at their age and I miss a lot now. I have what I asked for, and I don't think everything should change to accommodate me, but I would have to say that the Dail is not geared for good parenting. Having a more normal working day would be one improvement. You could get the train down at night and come up early the next morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having a mother as a politician puts a pressure on the children to behave in a certain way in public and I think that's no bad thing either. Anything that gives them pause for thought is good. The visibility is difficult for them. They implore me not to put posters on the poles outside school. It's not nice for them to have their mother slagged off in public. They like it when I'm praised, but they don't realise yet that you have to take the good with the bad. It will come. You can't put old heads on four young and beautiful shoulders.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Pg. 12</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOMETIME in the interregnum between the collapse of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition and the formation of the present rainbow alliance last year, the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Mr Des O'Malley, was heard on the radio paying tribute to Democratic Left. He and his party, he said, would have no difficulty working in a partnership government which included DL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was, on the face of it, an extraordinary moment in Irish politics, an embrace which crossed the entire ideological spectrum, from as far to the right as it gets to as far left as our electoral system has delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, such alliances were ruled out on &quot;ideological&quot; grounds. Yet, here was a leading politician implicitly acknowledging that such distinctions were either no longer relevant, or did not exist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the inclusion of Democratic Left in government, the last significant opposition force in Irish politics was assumed into the establishment, leaving only the Green Party outside the mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the DL Minister of State for Commerce, Science and Technology, Mr Pat Rabbitte, made a speech in Dublin City University in which he called for &quot;a vision in left politics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, although he explored reasons for the absence of such vision at present the collapse of communism, the influence of Thatcher and Reagan, and, in Irish politics, the failure of the Keynesian experiment of the 1970s the best Mr Rabbitte could come up with was a call for &quot;a more strategic approach, based on an understanding of how high social-cost economies, like those of northern Europe, continue to succeed&quot;, and something called &quot;corporate commitment to cooperative competition&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is continued soul-searching on the left of Irish politics, the reality is that the entire edifice is drifting inexorably to the right. The tolerance of the parliamentary system for parties of a vaguely left-wing ethos appears to diminish in proportion to their anxiety to articulate such an ethos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, such parties appear more than willing to jettison left-wing ideas as the &quot;price&quot; for participation in the political mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent DL document on banking, for example, touched on a number of highly pertinent arguments about the need for a wider economic view of the role of financial institutions, but these were lost in an argument which centred yet again on the issue of competition and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DL complained that the discussion focused on a small section of the document, to the exclusion of its wider analysis. But DL was the architect of its own misfortune firstly, in placing its main emphasis on competition, and secondly, in soft focusing its broader intentions to retain conservative appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of articulating a genuinely alternative vision, DL out of a desire for respectability has begun to repeat the same market incantations that we are sick of hearing from other parties. Who will unapologetically advance left-wing arguments if a party with the word &quot;Left&quot; in its name is afraid to do so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPPOSITION, of course, was never our strong suit. A society riddled with post- colonial complexes is not easily adapted to democratic structures. Despite the fine language of the 1937 Constitution, we have never developed an appropriate understanding of the rights of citizenship in a democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After independence, the colonial culture of dependency was replicated in the newly-formed State. Benefits of power were bestowed and disbursed through a culture of patronage, middlemen and bought loyalty. This, in turn, bred a culture of subservience, fear, unctuousness and mealy-mouthedness, which has not been hospitable to those critical of power and how it is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Institutions like party and church have been able to play people off in a manner which has sidelined all of the more refined concepts of democracy. Those who stand against this culture are driven out to the isolation of the margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was, for a period in the late 1960s and 1970s, the briefest stirrings of a different kind of society. With the prosperity of the Lemass era, it seemed that we might even begin to acquire a culture of radicalism, which would enable, even foster, dissent as a vital element of the democratic mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decade ago, Irish politics offered a mix of views which is unimaginable today. We now live in a society which, though apparently more refined in its pretensions and aspirations, lacks fundamental tolerance of the rudiments of vigorous democratic debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic contractions of the 1980s were partly to blame for the fleeting nature of the emerging radicalism, but a much more crucial factor was the developing crisis in the North, and, in particular, the armed force element of the IRA strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This resulted in a contamination of ideology, but especially of left-wing ideology. Sinn Fein the Workers' Party, the precursor of DL, was a central instrument in this process. &quot;We are, on the left today,&quot; said Pat Rabbitte at DCU, afraid of expressing commitment to a dream, a vision.&quot; He failed to mention that the party of which he is now a member has been, in one incarnation or another, largely responsible for this retreat from vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loudest voices in the land in the recent past have been those proclaiming a moral rejection of republican violence, and those on the left who chose to do so have managed, as a result, to gain a foothold in the mainstream, albeit at the cost of losing their radicalism in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it would be improper to regard all such voices in the same way, there is a general tendency in such denunciations, i.e. a neurotic dimension based on a profound guilt about some vaguely remembered wrong which Irish nationalism has inflicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has created an infection in southern political life which attacks any vaguely radical idea which is based on the fundamental connection of our condition to British colonialism or the attendant historical experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS is the problem which Pat Rabbitte is unable to put his finger on. The reason is simple: Official Sinn Fein, Sinn Fein the Workers' Party, the Workers' Party and Democratic Left, are all examples of left-wing parties which attempted to build an analysis of Ireland's problems on ground other than where it belonged. As Pearse said - He who builds on lies rears only lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that if Democratic Left wishes to rediscover its radical mission, it must go right back to the drawing board, to tackle the errors on which its entire philosophy was founded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means reappraising its traditional line on the national question. To do so now would take courage, but because of the party's and its predecessors' singular role in leading the field in the anti-republican, anti-nationalist backlash, such a reappraisal would have a profound effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHY WOULD more than 15 million Italians vote in favour of having feature films on television crudely and rudely interrupted by up to half-an-hour's worth of commercial breaks? Has the land of Dante, Michelangelo, Fellini et at lost all sensibility?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question arises in the wake of the results of this weekend's Italian referendums which, among other things, saw a majority vote against the introduction of a measure (along EU directive lines) which would have banned more than one advertising break during a feature film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a weekend distinguished by a resounding success for the media tycoon and ex-prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the question about TV ads might seem irrelevant. Not so. A majority of those voters who voted &quot;No&quot; on TV ads probably hate television commercials as much as anyone else.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point about their &quot;No&quot; vote is that it had little to do with broadcasting and everything to do with politics. That vote was not about television, rather it was proBerlusconi and anti-centre left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italians on Sunday were asked to vote in 12 referendums including issues as diverse as trade union organisation and shop-opening hours but dominated by referendum 10 on television ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to approve a measure that would prohibit an individual or private company from owning more than one nationwide television station, 57 per cent of voters responded &quot;No&quot;. The point about this proposal, of course, is that Mr Berlusconi, via his Fininvest Group, is the owner of three such nationwide commercial channels. Italians thus voted, in favour of the present anomalous situation which puts almost no limits on television ownership and which is clearly in contradiction with European Union directives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, as underlined by a constitutional court ruling last December, the present situation is unconstitutional. Mr Berlusconi's opponents had argued that the television-ownership referendum posed a fundamental question about potential abuse of media power in a democracy. They claimed that, since his entry into politics 15 months ago, he has consistently misused his channels for his own political ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of this campaign, they cite a four-week period when his channels showed 497 ads supporting his case and 31 against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEARLY, there are grounds for the defeated centre left to argue that the televisual cards were too unevenly stacked against them.  This does not alter the fact that Mr Berlusconi conducted a skilful campaign, persuading voters that his opponents were inspired more by personal and political vendetta than concern for the common good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ex-communist Democratic Left (PDS), the major proponents of the &quot;anti-Berlusconi&quot; referendums, was doubly defeated, losing out not only on three television referendums but also on one other concerning trade union organisation. These results appear to represent a dramatic turnaround from local elections of just six weeks ago at which Mr Berlusconi and his right-wing allies were heavy losers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubtless, the unusual nature of the referendum issues played its part. Doubtless, too, the emotional and unrelenting TV campaign waged by Mr Berlusconi's cast of Italian household names helped as well. It could also be, however, that these results underline the current instability of a political landscape which has yet to settle down after the earthquake effect of the Tangentopoli-inspired, post-Berlin Wall disappearance of an entire Christian Democrat/Socialist ruling class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt, though, about the political fallout of this vote. On the one hand, Mr Berlusconi has revived his sagging fortunes and has ensured that he, and no one else, will lead the right into the forthcoming general election, probably this autumn. The recent setbacks in local elections had led to criticism of his leadership but this result will have silenced opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the centre left is once more forced to reflect on the price paid for its failure either to present a united front or to wage an effective campaign. Significantly, the first important reaction to the weekend vote came from the currency markets where the lira immediately found itself under pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, economic analysts are concerned that Mr Berlusconi's victory will signal the end of the current &quot;technical&quot; government of the banker, Mr Lamberto Dini, as Italy moves towards an early election and yet another period of political turbulence. The economic analysts could be right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir, - The reasons for the decline (but hopefully not the fall) of the Irish Press newspapers are probably far more mundane than your editorial (June 6th) or your columnist Nuala O'Faolain (June 5th) would have us believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an inability to adapt the publications to the changed realities of Irish life, to redefine editorial and marketing policies in a new social landscape&quot; (editorial).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or Ms O'Faolain, daughter of distinctive Even jog Press social diarist, Terry O'Sullivan: &quot;. . . decline might be said to be due to getting contemporary Ireland wrong... or to staying 102, long with an out-of-date Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Might the decline in Irish Press circulation simply be the mistake of turning tabloid since an upmarket tabloid might be regarded as a contradiction in terms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not turning the Evening Press into a tabloid might, to use your editorial expression, classify as a &quot;disastrous management&quot; failure.  As for the Sunday Press commercially the most successful of the three was it not simply under-resourced and under-financed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general. your editorial frets about &quot;foreign imports&quot; eating steadily into the circulation figures of the indigenous press. If that is so does it indicate that the Irish print media, including The Irish Times, is &quot;failing to adapt to the changed realities&quot; or &quot;getting contemporary Ireland wrong&quot;? The argument has probably far more to do with, the economics of the newspaper industry here newspapers are too dear by comparison than with, getting it wrong culturally, nationally or socially. If the Irish Press has its standards and it has why decry them in however honeyed words? - Yours, etc.,</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> INDEPENDENT Newspapers is set to raise Pounds 75 million sterling through a bond issue in London this week. The money will be used to refinance its recent investment in the New Zealand newspaper group, Wilson and Horton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent, together with the family trust of its chairman, Dr Tony O'Reilly, acquired 28.3 per cent of the group for Pounds 120 million last month, of which Independent paid Pounds 60 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Newspapers, refused to comment yesterday. However, it is understood that the balance of the money raised above that needed for the latest New Zealand investment - around Pounds 15 million - will be used to finance further expansion. This might include further increasing its stake in Wilson and Horton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is not expected to be used to fund Independent's share of the restructuring costs of Newspaper Publishing in Britain, which could run to as much as Pounds 25 million. The investment in the loss making Newspaper Publishing's Independent and Independent on Sunday has already been funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 year bond is being organised by Bankers Trust. The coupon has not yet been set, but is expected to yield about 1 percentage point above the 8.5 per cent British government 10 year gilt, which is currently yielding around 8.15 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London bond market sources said that Independent opted to raise the money in the London market as British institutions have recently shown an appetite for newspaper company debt. They pointed to the successful Pounds 100 million bond issue undertaken by the The Daily Mail and General Trust, publisher of the Daily Mall, in London earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bond is not being targeted at Irish institutions, most of which are reluctant to buy bonds issued by companies, such as Independent Newspapers, which have not been rated for creditworthiness by an agency such as Moody or Standard and Poor. In addition, Irish institutions would have only a limited interest in fixed rate sterling debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Press, the vehicle used by Independent and the O'Reilly family to invest in Wilson and Horton is expected to increase its stake in the group. It has already increased it from 28.3 per cent to 29.4 per cent through buying in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 15 per cent stake in the company that is held by the Horton family is currently for sale, with some Horton family members willing to sell their stake in return for cash and/or some of the company's assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no laws restricting foreign ownership of the media in New Zealand and the New Zealand stock exchange does not have rules that require investors to make a full bid for a company once their stake exceeds a certain size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson and Horton is the largest newspaper group in New Zealand and has a stockmarket valuation of Pounds 384 million. Last month, the company reported a 11.2 per cent increase in pre tax profits to Pounds 28.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive of Independent Newspapers, Mr Liam Healy, has joined the board of Wilson and Horton as chairman and Mr Cameron O'Reilly is also joining the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Reilly, who is the son of Dr O'Reilly is deputy chief executive of Independent's Australian associate company, Australian Provincial Newspapers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CELTIC International, a subsidiary with Friends Provident of Eureko Ireland, is to become the first company to sell life assurance by telephone in the Irish market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eureko yesterday announced a reorganisation of its distribution arrangements aimed at increasing its share of the Irish life and general markets. Both life and general insurance products will now be sold through its new broker services division and its direct line telephone sales operation will be expanded to include life products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is aimed at capitalising on the existing customer bases of both the life and general businesses by cross selling products within the group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the integration of its sales effort, Eureko aims to double its current 2.1 per cent share of the non life market over the next three to four years and to raise its current 6.1 per cent share of the life market by 30 to 40 per cent, according to the managing director, Mr Mogens Kjaer. Eureko is aiming at a life market share of 7-8 per cent by 1998, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past four years, the company's share of the life market has risen from 3 to 6 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As competition in the Irish insurance industry intensifies, Mr Kjaer said the group was positioning itself for expansion by &quot;moving closer to the customer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focusing on what the customer wanted &quot;is the only basis for survival and growth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to now the Eureko companies have sold life assurance through Friends Provident, the sixth largest life company in the Irish market with premium income of Pounds 58 million in 1994. General insurance has been sold through Celtic International which had premium income of Pounds 26.2 million in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celtic International's telephone sales operation, Celtic Autoline, is to be renamed Celtic Direct because the original name no longer reflects the range of general insurance offered, Mr Kjaer said.  Celtic will add life assurance products to its motor, household and other general insurance products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Celtic International managing director, Mr Larry Joyce, declined to reveal the life products which would be sold by telephone he said they would be simple protection based products using simple understandable language&quot;. Term assurance is likely to be one product available by telephone, he agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the British market a number of companies have developed successful life assurance sales operations using the telephone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eureko operations in Holland and Portugal have successful telephone sales operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eureko is investing Pounds 7 million to update technology at its Galway telesales base where 150 people are employed and expansion was possible said Mr Joyce. However, the existing Galway infrastructure could cope with a higher workload and the new technology would increase capacity without having to raise the numbers employed, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All existing sales through brokers by Friends Provident and Celtic International will be amalgamated into Friends Provident Broker Services which will sell life and general services to a network of 1,200 brokers. Friends Provident will continue to underwrite all life business while Celtic will continue to underwrite all group general business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eureko is the Irish branch of the pan European Eureko Insurance Group. An alliance of large European insurers, it was formed three years ago to compete in the European single market. Shareholders include the British company, Friends Provident, (31 per cent); Dutch company Achmea, (27.3 per cent); Swedish company, WASA (19.9 per cent); Danish company, Topdanmark (11.8 per cent); and the Portuguese company, BCP/Ocidental (10 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based in Amsterdam, the group has life and general businesses throughout Europe, and a reinsurance operation and subsidiaries in the USA, Canada and Eastern Europe. Eureko came into the Irish market in July 1993 when it acquired Celtic International for an undisclosed sum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celtic had introduced the concept of telephone sales into the Irish insurance market in 1987 when it offered motor insurance by telephone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, Eureko acquired Friends Provident and NM Life as part of a share swap arrangement between the shareholders in the holding group.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LEADING dairy group Unigate is to make 1,500 workers redundant as part of a Pounds 55 million restructuring package. The decision is in response to upheavals in the British milk industry following last autumn's abolition of the Milk Marketing Board. The heavy job losses at Unigate are likely to be followed by an announcement today of a similar retrenchment programme at Northern Foods.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dairy Trade Federation estimates that 10,000 jobs will be lost, through a decline in those employed in doorstep milk deliveries and through plant closures. Last autumn's abolition of the Milk Marketing Board was accompanied by continued control of milk prices by the newly formed Milk Marque brokerage owned by dairy farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to elsewhere in Europe, British milk prices have increased by 11 per cent undermining the ability of dairy firms dependent on British milk to compete in key product areas, such as cheese, with Irish and European dairy businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate, said the group's Unigate Dairies business was already under significant pressure from the switch in sales away from the doorstep to supermarkets. Dramatic cost increases had exacerbated this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of these changed circumstances, a radical review and restructuring of costs across the group's dairy businesses has been undertaken, he said. Restructuring provisions of Pounds 55.1 million are disclosed in the group's fell year figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pounds 55 million three year restructuring package involves plans for a 40 per cent reduction in liquid milk bottling capacity over the next three years as well as rationalisation of the group's St Ivel dairy products and Wincanton milk haulage activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restructuring charge has cut Unigate's pre tax profits by 43 per cent from Pounds 102 million to Pounds 58 million in the year to March 31st.  But annual cost savings will amount to around Pounds 25 million after the cutbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating losses suffered by dairy activities in the past year were offset by a strong performance achieved on fresh foods and by first time contributions from acquisitions. This is reflected in a 2.7 per cent increase in operating profits of continuing businesses to Pounds 117 million leading to a 4 per cent increase in underlying earnings per share to 36.8p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total dividend payments are increased 5.2 per cent to 18.2p where the payout is still twice covered by underlying earnings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IBM's $ 3.52 billion acquisition of Lotus Development Corp - which changed from a hostile to friendly takeover - promises to dramatically shake up the market for computer software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lotus announced on Sunday that it was accepting IBM's offer, after initially rejecting it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cambridge, Massachusetts based company was not in a position to fend off a takeover bid from the computer giant, which would be the largest computer industry merger ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lotus, the world's third largest software company, agreed to be bought for $ 64 a share. The agreed price per share was four dollars higher than what IBM offered when it launched a hostile takeover bid less than a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The merger now leaves IBM on improved ground to challenge software industry leader Microsoft Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM shattered its image as a gentle giant by initiating the bid as a hostile takeover, in what would have been a first, after Lotus executives rejected offers in five months of private talks. The Lotus Notes product was the main attraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global market for communications software or &quot;groupware&quot; reached $ 2.3 billion in 1994, a 13 per cent increase from a year earlier, according to the Dataquest research group. Sales in that sector are likely to increase by 70 per cent over the next four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market leader Microsoft claims an 18.7 per cent share of the software market, according to one research group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Novell, a strong force in the business network market and likely groupware leader, controls 7.7 per cent. IBM has a 3.7 per cent share, and Lotus has 3.2 per cent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profits increased despite a 7&quot; per cent fall in sales to Pounds 81 million. The fall in sales reflected the sale in the middle of the year of the group's Halbergs jewellery chain which had contributed sales of Pounds 11 million in the previous year as well as a fall of Pounds 2.5 million to Pounds 3 million in sales in Britain, according to Oriflame financial director, Mr Haken Martenssen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower costs boosted margins with the pre-tax margin up from 16.1 per cent to 19.5 per cent. The cost of sales was 13.4 per, cent lower at Pounds 30.2 million while administrative costs were 5.9 per cent down at Pounds 39.5 million. Operating profits were 13 per cent higher at Pounds 14.2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year the group has been restructured to concentrate on core operations direct sales of cosmetics and skincare products.  Oriflame's Irish manufacturing operation currently supplies about 75 per cent of group production. Oriflame has 400 direct sales consultants in the Irish market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As sales increase in the high growth markets of Chile and Peru the group will consider setting up manufacturing operations in Latin America because of the high cost of shipping large quantities of cosmetics. A new manufacturing plant with roughly half the capacity of the Dublin plant will be opened this year in Poland to supply the Polish market and other Eastern European markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oriflame has raised its dividend for the year by 8 per cent to 14p per share. Earnings per share were 13 per cent higher at 25.2p.  Long-term borrowings were down from Pounds 7.6 million to Pounds 1.5 million.</SPAN></P>

Newry Building Supplies, which produces a range of machine-cut timbers and decorative mouldings, is building a 15,000 square foot warehouse at the company's premises in the Greenbank Industrial Estate, as well as purchasing a range of sawing, moulding packaging, and computer equipment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing director, Mr Ciaran Murdock, said the investment, which is backed by a grant of Pounds 350,000 from the IDB, was aimed at increasing sales in Northern Ireland the Republic, and to a lesser extent in Great Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our primary target is the Republic of Ireland,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a lot of potential in the DIY industry in the South. The development of the industry is being led by three major retailers and they are investing heavily in new outlets throughout the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Murdock said that nearly all DIY timbers sold in the Republic were currently imported from Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe we can gain a substantial share of this market,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newry Building Supplies and its sister company, Murdock Building Supplies in Banbridge, are part of Carneyhaugh Holdings, which is owned by the &quot;Murdock family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment is expected to lead to the creation of 45 new jobs by the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in Newry, Allmark, which makes reflective marker boards and signs for commercial vehicles, is investing over Pounds 500,000 in a new factory and equipment on the Carnbane Industrial Estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All mark, a subsidiary of the Allen Group of High Wycombe, sells over 60 per cent of its output to customers outside Britain. The general manager, Mr Sean Tumilty, said the company's main aim was to increase sales in Europe</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A FALL of 11p in the Irish Permanent share price to 310p was the main feature of an otherwise dull day. The leading stocks were generally weaker as the market for once did not follow the pattern set in London and New York which both moved into positive territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall in the Irish Permanent share price was not seen as a cause for undue concern despite its size. The share has been driven upwards steadily since the flotation last year with a very good run seen over the last four weeks. The shortage of stock is a major technical factor behind the price rise and yesterday's fall either represented profit taking or the impact of a reasonably large chunk of the stock being, sold off for some other reason, maintained brokers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two main banks were also weaker with AIB down 2p at 291 and Bank of Ireland falling 3p to 342p. Irish Life was 2p lower at 208p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunloe continues to fall with, reports over the weekend that Ben Duane is frying off load his, shareholding in the company driving it down from 16p to 12p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of Mr Ben Dunne using the company as a vehicle for some new projects has been the major support behind the company's share-price in recent years, but the way now appears to be being prepared for Mr Dunne's exit. However, brokers point out that it rarely pays to try and out guess the unpredictable Mr Duane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Newspapers was 1/2p weaker at 302p as the company prepares to raise Pounds 75 million through a bond issue in London. Most of the money has already been spent as it will be used to refinance Independent's Pounds 60 million investment in the New Zealand newspaper group, Wilson and Horton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was some activity among second line stocks with Clondalkin falling 10p to 310p and Heiton dropping 4p to 70p. One investor that appears to remain keen on Heitons is DCC, which announced that it has now increased its stake to 24.53 per cent. DCC was unchanged at 210p.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRADING in British equities began what promises to be a busy week, featured by a barrage of economic news, in traditional Monday fashion yesterday. The market shrugged off early weakness and thereafter made steady, if rather sluggish progress, helped by a strong opening by Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of trading the FTSE 100 index was 6.9 higher at 3346.6. The FTSE Mid-250 index, however, substantially underperformed the senior index, sliding 19.6 to 3659.3. Over the past two trading sessions the Mid-250 index has fallen over 38 points or 1 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns that Friday's worrying slide in the Dow Jones Average, which at one point fell over 50 points, triggering Wall Street's &quot;circuit breakers&quot;, would carry over into the new week came to nothing. The Dow Jones Average opened in fine fettle and was up almost 40 points an hour after London closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was some slight concern, however, at the continuing lack of progress by US Treasury bonds, bunds and gilts. Long-dated gilts, up over 1/4 early in the session slipped back to unchanged before edging ahead at the close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most dealers, while unconvinced that Wall Street will be able to hang on to its recent gains, still see room for modest upside in British equities. They warned, however, that the market place could turn into a minefield this week as the economic news unfolds and as many of the big international futures and options contracts expire at the end of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today brings the first of a long list of economic numbers from the US, notably consumer price data and retail sales for May. The inflation numbers will be closely scrutinised for signs of pressures which could have a big influence on the July 5th meeting of the US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Britain, market-makers said Wednesday, and Thursday would be crunch days for the market as details emerge on average earnings, unemployment figures, unit wage costs, inflation and retail sales. On Wednesday evening, the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, is expected to outline his inflation target for the rest of the parliamentary term in his annual speech at the Mansion house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Share prices were marked lower at the outset of trading with market-makers lowering their opening prices to try to tempt sellers into the market in the wake of Friday's retreat on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 began trading almost 10 points lower but quickly clawed back early losses.</SPAN></P>

Stocks ignored an anaemic bond market which finished unchanged and a weaker dollar, and focused instead on comments by Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, that prospects for a mild recession had increased.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks gave new life to hopes that the Fed the US central bank would cut interest rates this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks usually respond well to lower interest rates because they make equities more attractive than bonds and lower the cost of borrowing for businesses as well as spurring consumer purchases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His presence will be particularly welcome in the light of a stirring, recent play off battle in which Philip Walton beat him for the Murphy's English Open title.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomerie, who will be 32 this month, holds the distinction of leader of the European Order of Merit for the last two years and is ranked seventh in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After losing a play off to Ernie Els for the US Open at Oakmont last year, he competed at Mount Juliet, where typically solid rounds of 70, 70, 72 and 71 gave him a share of 24th place behind the winner, Bernhard Langer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be one of the leading Europeans in the US Open which starts at Shinnecock Hills on Thursday, and is also certain to be a key figure in the battle to regain the Ryder Cup from the US at Oak Hill, Rochester, in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top competitors in the Irish Open are: Greg Norman, Langer, Montgomerie, Seve Ballesteros, Jose Maria Olazabal, Ian Woosnam and the lone American, Craig Stadler.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHEN I come across yet another conference devoted to saving the West, I often wonder about the directional exclusivity of the rescue mission which has been going on for 30 years or more now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, for instance, doesn't somebody turn their mind to saving the midlands? Or the south east? Perhaps it's the case that these tranches of the national territory are already saved. Not so the West, which appears chronically in need of saving and so is a constant subject for grave deliberation at recurrent conferences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The usual suspects were rounded up to contribute to the latest conference on the West, under the chairmanship of Dr John Bowman, in Galway at the weekend. The contributions were valuable and indeed if many of the ideas were pursued in a practical way the West might indeed be saved, though I'm never quite sure what that would mean.  Saved from itself? Saved from the unimaginative policies of successive governments? Or saved from the gas bag of talk that's being perpetually released on its behalf?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the keynote speakers, Dr Micheal O Cinneide of UCG, made the rather unsettling prediction that rural depopulation was likely to continue, or even accelerate, not only in the West but throughout the country. However he pointed out that, despite the flight from the land, the present population of the countryside was still three quarters of what it had been 60 years ago. Things, it seems, are far worse in the Scandinavian countries where the areas outside the cities are almost empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, as long as people remain, there's hope for regeneration. But my heart goes down in my boots when I see people pinning their hopes for development on projects like a prison in Castlerea. Jobs or no jobs, I cannot understand why people would want a prison in their back yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the projected prison, it had been a psychiatric hospital that primed much of Castlerea's economic well being. Fortunately, the government phased out Castlerea and a number of other such institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One could hardly find more negative symbols of &quot;development&quot; than a prison or a psychiatric hospital. Unless, of course, we recall Swift's words about nobody being in greater need of a mental hospital than the Irish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Government was &quot;lurching from one extreme to the other&quot; on the economy, the Fianna Fail leader, Mr Bertie Ahern, told a by election rally in Wicklow town at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Public service embargos tend to be crude and inflexible instruments, and are not always conducive to efficiency,&quot; he said.  The last embargo was introduced by Fine Gael/Labour in July 1981, when John Bruton was Minister for Finance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of these measures would be necessary if tight control on spending had not been relaxed in the first place. Very poor judgment has been displayed by the Government, which is lurching from one extreme to the other, instead of ensuring the confidence and stability demanded by sound management of our nation's financial resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party's candidate in Wicklow, Senator Dick Roche, said the current Government had often been compared to a rainbow but he preferred to see it as a jigsaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like most jigsaws I've come across, there's a piece missing. In this particular case, it's very clear that the piece missing from the Government is common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mervyn White, a resident at the controversial Clonmannon retirement village, paid tribute to Senator Roche for his work on the issue. Five residents of the village were in attendance at the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier in Wicklow town, the Democratic Left candidate, Dr John McManus, said a Fianna Fail poll had given him the third highest percentage of first, preferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing Fianna Fail sources, he said the poll results were as follows: Senator Roche (Fianna Fail), 28 per cent; Mr Tom Honan (Fine Gael), 21 per cent Dr McManus (Democratic Left) 16 per cent; and Dr Tim Collins (Labour), 12 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Fianna Fail spokesman denied that a poll had been carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Independent TD, Mr Tony Gregory, has urged the voters of Wicklow to support Mr Nicky Kelly, who was wrongfully convicted of the Sallins train robbery and is now an independent candidate in the by election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Bray, Mr Gregory said: I think Nicky Kelly would be very effective in the Dail and would use his position well in the interests of the people of this constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said the seat held by the late Mr Johnny Fox should be retained as an independent seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A good strong independent is worth half a dozen backbenchers who are shackled by the party whip and can't speak out on the issues that affect their constituents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Workers' Party candidate, Mr Frank Hayes, was critical of Labour and Democratic Left. &quot;All the parties who faked being left wing, all the parties who pretended to have some commitment to socialist ideals are in there, in the most right wing Government this state has ever had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Workers' Party was committed to putting people before profits, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The millions and millions of pounds that are sucked out of this country in multinational profits and, indeed, national profits that are exported, can be used better, to provide the jobs and the things, that people need in our country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> POLITICS is hard. Having lost the Fianna Fail nomination to Senator Dick Roche by a single vote at the Fianna Fail selection convention, Mr Michael Lawlor found himself at his party's election rally in the Arklow Bay Hotel one night last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the speeches were over, it came: the inevitable, the unavoidable, the statutory standing ovation. For any mortal, to applaud your victorious opponent in these circumstances is difficult to stand while doing so, almost impossible. But Mr Lawlor managed it.  He stood with the best of them. Clap, clap, clap. Then he sat down.  It was a Fianna Fail performance in the classic mould.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fianna Fail itself is changing, but is it changing quickly enough?  As the crowd milled about after the rally and Senator Roche smiled sweetly and shook hands, a senior party strategist mused on the right approach to winning this by election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all a question of style, he said. In the past, the party's canvassers would present themselves at people's front doors with the message: &quot;We're here; we're Fianna Fail; we want your number one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes the voter would be supporting a different party. Then, as the Fianna Fail activist puts it, the canvassers would &quot;casually&quot; appeal for a transfer with some such formula as: &quot;Well, sure you'll give us the 'scratch' anyway?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That approach has to change, he says, and it has to change in the Wicklow by election. Number twos, threes, fours and even fives could be crucial. On past figures, no candidate can win on the first count, and that includes Senator Roche, who is seen as the front runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like others in the main parties, the Fianna Fail activist is taking a particular interest in the transfers of the Independent candidates because these could decide the issue. He takes the example of Nicky Kelly, wrongfully convicted of the Sallins train robbery and now a local councillor in Arklow and a candidate in the by election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If one assumes that Kelly performs best among the non party candidates, that his voters give high preferences to other Independents and that they are all eliminated eventually, then Kelly's fourth or fifth preferences could decide the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key for the main parties, as the Fianna Fail man sees it, is to secure those fourth or fifth &quot;scratches&quot; on the ballot paper. Of course, the leading Independent could be Mildred Fox or Susan Philips. It's factors such as these that make the Wicklow poll so complex and intriguing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last year and for the first time in the history of the State the Government changed without an election. The June 29th poll in the Wicklow constituency, which incorporates part of east Kildare, will be the first chance for voters anywhere to give a verdict on the new arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also be a test for John Bruton as Taoiseach and Bertie Ahern as the new Fianna Fail leader. Fine Gael activists admit there was &quot;market resistance&quot; to their leader in the 1992 general election but insist this is no longer the case. &quot;He's an electoral asset now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fine Gael standard bearer is Mr Tom Honan, a youngish Arklow based solicitor and county councillor. The party is putting most of its effort into a door to door canvass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of the 66 members of the Fine Gael parliamentary party has been given responsibility for a bloc of about 1,200 voters, to be canvassed intensively. &quot;We'll be promoting the message that the Government is doing a good job,&quot; says a senior party figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fine Gael slogan is &quot;Strengthen the Government: vote Honan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be claiming that the Fine Gael led government has brought about improved accountability in politics, strengthened the peace process and boosted the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fine Gael candidate will be heavily promoted in North Wicklow where he is not well known. They believe that the more doors he gets to, the more votes he will get. But it's important to have a Minister or Minister of State in tow: &quot;Then you've a good chance of softening up the client.&quot; People of Wicklow, you have been warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the many sub plots in the Wicklow saga, there is the &quot;Battle of the Red Doctors&quot; (pink would probably be more appropriate). The two main left wing parties are represented by Dr Tim Collins of Labour and Dr John McManus of Democratic Left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everywhere you go in the constituency, there seem to be full length colour posters of Dr Collins. A local journalist, Mr Shay Fitzmaurice of the Wicklow Times, described the design as the Reservoir Dogs look, after the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins is eager, hungry, and people say he won't give up even if he loses this time. Although the sitting Labour TD, Mr Liam Kavanagh, is reported to be playing his part in the Labour campaign, it must have crossed his mind that winning two Labour seats in Wicklow in the general election will be a formidable proposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But observers say the more often Collins is seen in public with Kavanagh as at last week's Labour campaign launch - the better Labour's chances of victory. Kavanagh's base is in Wicklow town, but Collins's best chance of votes is thought to lie in the &quot;commuter belt&quot; in the north of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Collins insists Labour can win and hold two seats: &quot;Bray and Greystones together have half the population of the county. There's a very strong Labour vote there which we have to tap. If we can tap, it in this election and hang on to it, I believe it's sustainable to have two Labour TDs in Wicklow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine Gael is weak in north, Wicklow, and Collins could benefit from this. He is stressing his record on environmental issues: he has worked as an adviser in the Department of the Environment with both Mary Harney and Brendan Howlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It must also have crossed the minds of Democratic Left that a Labour TD in Bray could threaten them in the general election. The DL sitting member in Wicklow is the Minister of State for Housing and Urban Renewal, Ms Liz McManus, who is married to the party's by election candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inevitably there have been charges that, if Dr McManus wins, he will only &quot;keep the seat warm&quot; for the Minister of State, but at the party's launch in the Royal Hotel in Bray last week he declared his intention to remain in &quot;national politics&quot; if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same event, Proinsias De Rossa kept reminding the pundits that DL has won two of the last four by elections. He suggested they were deriving their political analysis from the figures in Ted Nealon's Guide to the Dail and Seanad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr McManus has stood for the Dail on several occasions in the past, when he proved a considerable vote puller. Indeed, it could be said that he laid the ground work for his wife's victory in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the family connection will be used against him, sources in other parties concede that McManus could do well. If he can pull ahead of Collins in the early counts, the Labour man's transfers could see him home. If Collins can get ahead, however, Labour could be ordering the champagne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Labour and DL are coalition partners, the contest between them will have to be somewhat muted. But it is a real race nevertheless. Collins recently moved to the constituency, and his house is only 50 yards from the McManuses' front door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participation of well known Independent candidates makes the result even harder to predict. There will be a strong sympathy vote for Ms Mildred Fox, as she seeks to replace her father, the late Johnny Fox, in the Dail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fate of Labour's Lisa O'Sullivan, daughter of the late Gerry O'Sullivan, in the Cork North Central poll last November showed that sympathy doesn't pull votes the way it used to. Nevertheless, Ms Fox's votes are expected to have a strong bearing on the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same is broadly true of Mr Nicky Kelly and Ms Susan Philips.  For different reasons, each of them has a high profile in the constituency. The anti abortion and pro family party Muintir na hEireann has declared its support for both Ms Fox and Ms Philips, but observers believe this may alienate more moderate voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election of Ms Nuala Ahern to the European Parliament meant that the Greens lost their most formidable challenger for this Dail seat. But environmental issues are particularly significant in a constituency so close to the Sellafield and Thorp nuclear power stations, and the Green candidate, Ms Emer Singleton, stands to benefit electorally from this concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Frank Hayes, who stood for the Workers' Party in 1992, is the WP's standard bearer attain this time, and the fact that the two main left wing parties are currently in Government should be to his advantage. A former Labour Party member, Mr Charlie Keddy, who has been active on the issue of local authority service charges, will be running as an Independent candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a debate involving Senator Roche and the three Government candidates on the local East Coast Radio last week was notable for its extreme caution. So far, candidates are treading carefully, but this will probably change as the campaign warms up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only safe prediction at this stage is that the Wicklow by election result will be close. Fianna Fail's leader, Bertie Ahern, is putting in a big personal effort but he doesn't need reminding that the party's vote in Wicklow in 1992 was its lowest in any constituency. If the Government parties can work out a smooth transfer arrangement, they could carry the day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WITHOUT proper regional authorities with the powers to prepare strategic plans for their areas, Ireland would not be able to set itself on a path of &quot;sustainable development&quot; for the 21st century, a major environmental conference in Dublin Castle heard at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Michael Bannon, acting head of the planning school at UCD, said the existing regional authorities were &quot;meaningless&quot; because they did not have any real planning powers. In Dublin's case, this meant that it would be nearly impossible to stem the city's overspill into adjoining counties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said sustainable development, as agreed at the 1992 Earth Summit, was not something that would just happen; it had to be planned for by &quot;empowered local and regional authorities&quot;. The Minister for the Environment also needed to use the power he had to issue directives on all aspects of planning policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His views were echoed by Prof Adrian Phillips of TCD who said an &quot;unsustainable city&quot; was being produced by the &quot;vacuum in regional planning. He also warned that the proposed motorway serving Dublin Port would cost twice as much as the estimated Pounds 100 million and lead to &quot;economic disaster&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were both speaking at the concluding session of &quot;Local Agenda 21: Our Environment, the Future&quot;, which was jointly organised by An Taisce, Dublin Corporation, the Department of the Environment and the Dublin based European Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living Conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of the conference, initiated by Dublin's Lord Mayor, Mr John Gormley, is to promote an agenda for sustainable development at local level for the 21st century, based on good environmental practice and public participation in decision making, to implement the commitments made at the Earth Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Frank Convery, national chairman of An Taisce, said the &quot;ownership&quot; of decisions by the people most directly affected was central to the Agenda 21 concept. Thus, local government reform should be designed &quot;to meet the public's demand for grassroots involvement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also queried the &quot;give it a lash&quot; school of economic development. &quot;For an exam oriented culture such as Ireland - where performance evaluation pervades everything from the Leaving Cert to Irish dancing - it is surprising that we wander into enormous public expenditures without having decided how success is to be measured&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the urban renewal designated areas - &quot;islands of tax privilege&quot; - he said the failure to carry out an architectural inventory before the influx of investors had led inevitably to the &quot;gratuitous destruction of key assets&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr John O'Sullivan, national planning officer of An Taisce, challenged a claim made by the Minister for the Environment, Mr Howlin, that the Temple Bar area of Dublin was &quot;a working model of sustainable development in an urban context&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Taisce rejected this notion, not least because there was no mechanism for public consultation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Long standing problems like Lough Sheelin and Lough Derg, as well as recent disasters on the Awbeg and Shournagh rivers, owe their origin to farm pollution,&quot; he said, warning &quot;Irish rivers will become a mass grave for aquatic life.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By PADRAIG YEATES, Industry and Employment Correspondent</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOME NEWS; Pg. 7</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Minister for Health, Mr Noonan, has said he believes difficulties posed by the curb on public sector recruitment for the health services can be overcome. He is also willing to meet the Irish Nurses Organisation to discuss its special concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr Phil Flynn, has said he believes that the Government can still meet its commitments in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, including those covering health and education.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the deputy general secretary of the INO, Mr Liam Doran, said yesterday that his union might have to consider strike action if adequate assurances cannot be given that extra posts required in acute hospitals' will be filled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The posts are needed to compensate for the loss of over 4,000 student nurses, who are to be diverted from the hospital wards to the universities for training over the next three to four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Noonan told The Irish Times at the weekend that difficulties had been created for his Department by the Pounds 77 million cut in Government spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he would be obliged to go back to the Government to seek approval for extra posts, he said there were provisions under the PCW for the care needs of special groups. &quot;The mechanism is there but each case will have to be fought on its merits,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department has a budget of Pounds 2.3 billion and employs 54,000 people. This gave scope for some flexibility, Mr Noonan said. He would be instructing health boards and chief executives to examine their expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he expressed confidence that the issue of student nurses could be dealt with adequately. &quot;Money for students is in the estimates for 1995,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't even think I'll have to slow it down next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Flynn urged unions to look at what was being proposed. He told The Irish Times yesterday: &quot;We examined the statement and we noted, first of all, that existing job levels were being maintained and secondly that PCW commitments on health and education are going to be honoured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also noted that if any additional posts were required, they were not embargoed, but would require Government approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally have no problem with that. I would expect a government to be prudent and to institute controls on public expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for many years we have been calling for a practice where, when new legislation was going through the Oireachtas, it would be costed and the staffing implications outlined as part of the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This would produce greater transparency. We're tired of having macro economic public service pay figures quoted at us and interpreted as if everyone in the public service was benefiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Flynn and the chief executive of IBEC, Mr John Dunne, rejected a report in the Sunday Business Post that the social partners had been informed that there would be no tax concessions in the next Budget, saying they had received no such indication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAST week IBM surprised everybody in the computer world with its first ever hostile takeover bid, offering $ 3.3 billion in cash to buy Lotus. Even in an industry ripe with takeovers, strategic alliances and a rapid concentration of major players, this is still a massive deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. What do they mean by &quot;hostile&quot;?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basically it means it's without the agreement of Lotus's board - they spurned IBM's earlier overtures. This would be the biggest takeover in the software industry's history - and the bidding could rise higher than that again - possibly reaching $ 4 billion. But IBM is currently cash rich, with $ 10 billion on hand, and a further $ 10 billion credit facility if needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Who are Lotus?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third largest personal computer software firm in the world (after Microsoft and Novell). Mitch Kapor founded them in 1982 with just eight employees, and they were an overnight success, er, a year later when Kapor designed the Lotus 1-2-3 financial spreadsheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Never heard of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time it was the &quot;killer app&quot; of personal computing: the killer software application which this first generation of hardware manufacturers particularly Apple - had been waiting for. It made personal computers useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1-2-3 was eventually overtaken by Microsoft's Excel. Then in the early 1990s Lotus branched into communications software - programs such as Lotus Notes, which allows people on separate computers in large organisations to collaborate and communicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But why the buyout?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While software is now a $ 12 billion business for IBM, it has always been a big headache for the company, which traditionally concentrated on manufacturing hardware. And in software there are no prizes for finishing fourth: Microsoft rules when it comes to user interfaces, Novell owns the main PC network operating system, and Oracle has the leading &quot;distributed database&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM wants to expand the market for its relatively new OS/2 Warp operating system, the main rival of Microsoft's Windows. So it probably figures it needs Lotus for applications to add to OS/2, which is currently on about nine million PCs around the world (that sounds a lot, but 90 million machines use Windows). Many analysts reckon the IBM Lotus combination wouldn't have much impact on Microsoft's dominant share of the market. Even so, IBM's bid would at least keep competition alive in a growing field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or as trade magazine PC Letter's David Corsey puts it: &quot;It means for Microsoft that OS/2 won't go away as quickly as it might have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. What else would IBM get?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highly successful Lotus Notes (over a million copies sold) a market leader and potential blockbuster. It lets users at locations throughout a corporation send electronic memos to each other, jointly work on the same document, call up databases, and fill orders without having to use paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notes has the potential to do for IBM what Windows did for Microsoft,&quot; reckons technology analyst Bruce Smith. &quot;It can reestablish its position in the PC industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Lotus products include the leading e mail program cc:Mail, and SmartSuite, a package of software programs for office workers.  SmartSuite used to be the No. 2 desktop application suite in the market after Microsoft Office, but was pushed off that pedestal earlier this year by Novell's Perfect Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. So IBM could be onto a winner?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going by their past record? This is the same empire which almost threw away the PC market after inventing it. The same mainframe giant which Microsoft's twentysomething boss Bill Gates ran rings around with DOS and Windows. The same massive bureaucracy of the 1970s and 1980s, which Robert Helter described in his recent book about IBM as a High Church, where &quot;new initiatives tended to come by Papal decree&quot;. Then when the cutbacks and &quot;re engineering&quot;came, it had morale problems which make last week's Liechtenstein match look like a schoolyard kickabout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But what about those funny TV commercials?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pundits would argue that they reflect an attempt to change its image and its corporate culture. Since Louis Gerstner became chairman two years ago, they've reorganised various divisions decided to ditch the huge corporate headquarters on a 450 acre campus at Armonk in New York for a smaller HQ nearby, and are reporting record profits after several disastrous years. Oh, and in an industry where the standard uniform is now Donkey Kong T shirts and designer stubble, they've even abandoned their strict dress code (dark suits/ white shirts for men, dresses or skirts for women) which was decades old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much of all this is purely cosmetic, only time will tell. But the Lotus takeover would have been unthinkable within the corridors at Armonk four or five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Are there any likely obstacles to the deal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti trust regulations this comes only three weeks after the US Justice Department called a halt to the $ 2 billion marriage of Microsoft and another major software firm, Intuit. But the regulators will probably determine that Lotus and IBM's products don't overlap.  It's both a &quot;horizontal&quot; merger (between software rivals) and a &quot;vertical&quot; one (between a hardware and software maker). Such vertical mergers are harder to challenge on competitive grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, such a high profile deal is bound to invite scrutiny, and Lotus could counter IBM's hostile offer with a lawsuit to delay the buyout. It might argue that IBM had inside information - it was privy to some of Lotus's internal documents when the two were discussing possible joint ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's an outside change that other players could step in too.  AT&amp;T, for example, has arguably the most to lose from the takeover, because it has been strategically linked to Lotus over the past year on the AT&amp;T Network Notes project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Any Irish connection?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lotus Development Ireland has been here 10 years, and employs about 400 people at its north Dublin base in Santry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And what does Mitch Kapor think of all this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, he left Lotus in 1986 and had little contact with them since. The company went into decline (last year it lost $ 20.8 million on sales of $ 970.7 million). Then last Thursday he picked up the phone and broke a nine year silence about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sad about Lotus's likely imminent demise as a separate entity because it's my child, even though I've been distant from it for a very long time,&quot; he told a Reuters reporter. &quot;One day in 1986 I walked out, I left. I did not want to run a big company, a fact I didn't know until I was running one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem has been that Lotus's traditional business in desktop applications has been put under pressure by Microsoft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MARX, Engels and Lenin are still visible on the old school wall at Ngash in eastern Tigre. The faded trio are stencilled into the stone.  The locals call them the &quot;three foreign devils&quot; of the deposed president, Mengistu Haile Mariam, leader of the military coup which seized power from Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mengistu's junta, known as the Dergue, forged a brutal, totalitarian state. About 500,000 people died in purges and bombings until Mengistu's fall in May 1991 after 17 years of civil war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel victors, the EPRDF (the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front quickly established a transitional government which promised democratic elections. Some observers were cynical since the TPLF the Tigrean liberation movement in control of the EPRDF - described itself as socialist and was a fan of Lenin and Marx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the TPLF leader, Meles Zenawi, became president, and the EPRDF government has now seen the country through its first democratic election, last month. That resulted in a landslide for the ruling EPRDF. The new constitution, which establishes a federal republic with a strong human rights charter, will now be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the more extreme opposition groups boycotted the election, international observers praised it as professional and fair. That will ensure the continued flow of international aid to one of the oldest cultures and poorest countries in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the wall stencils, Lenin and Marx have gradually faded from TPLF vocabulary and been replaced by the market economy and social democracy. In Tigre the physical changes are dramatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New roads, bridges, schools and hospitals have been built; telecommunications and electricity networks have been restored; and people are gradually recovering not just from the war, but from the dark years of famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunger became a weapon in Mengistu's arsenal. His policy of forced resettlement from Tigre to the south has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths in the wake of the 1984-85 famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Drought will be part of our future, but not famine,&quot; says Samson Tekele in Adigrat. He is in charge of an ambitious reforestation and micro dam programme. &quot;Mengistu starved us, stopped food aid and bombed areas in the midst of a famine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Power has been given back to the people, not just in their own regions but in their own ethnic nationalities,&quot; Aragash Adana, a senior administrator in Tigre's capital, Mekele, says. She was a TPLF fighter during the war and is now one of the key decision makers in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Haile Selassie and Mengistu enforced a &quot;one Ethiopia, one people&quot; policy which put the Amhara people and their language on top.  Other ethnic groups and languages were repressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution, which is opposed by the Amharic opposition, recognises Ethiopia's ethnicity, with 80 separate tribes and 100 languages, and creates a federal state of nine regions with devolved powers. It even includes the right of regions to secede from the central state, although Amharic is still the official language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leader Dr Beyene Petros claims the EPRDF is destroying Ethiopia by advocating balkanisation. But according to Dr Abdulmejid Hussein, the Minister for External Economic Cooperation, federalism simply reflects the diversity of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is the leader of the Somali Democratic League, one of the small parties participating in government with the EPRDF. Without giving the regions autonomy there can be no future peace, he insists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tigre the TPLF remains the voice of the people. There is no opposition, but the TPLF is popular and has delivered real benefits to the peasants, particularly women, who have more power there than in any other region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Tigreans the years of war have cut deeply. Outside Mekele a gigantic rocket like monument is being built in memory of the victims - including the 2,500 people killed in Hausien, a market town devastated by aerial bombing in June 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Tigreans defeated Mengistu the TPLF leader, Meles Zenawi, has shown he is bigger than Tigre and able to balance the interests of a multi racial Ethiopia. The elections gave the EPRDF international legitimacy and Meles, who will now become the Ethiopian prime minister, has shown he can both toe the line with the World Bank and run democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Ethiopia is now the main recipient in Africa of both US and German aid shows how strategic it has become. Ireland has also increased its aid since it set up an embassy there over a year ago, and this year alone over Pounds 3 million is being spent on development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most Ethiopians life may not be materially better. But according to Tedesse Giles, an agricultural researcher, there is at last the taste of freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brother and nephew were killed during the Dergue's Red Terror campaign. &quot;People were living in hell, now they are breathing fresh air. They may still be poor but people are feeling new hope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, like South Africa, may become a positive symbol for modern Africa. The Ogaden and Afar regions will not vote until next Sunday, June 18th. But the only question remaining is not who will sit in the new federal and provincial councils but whether the extreme opposition groups which have drawn support from the urban middle classes and from supporters of the old Dergue regime will play their part in building democracy, or stay outside sniping away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Addis Ababa some opposition members accuse the EPRDF of human rights abuses, but concrete evidence is thin. The transitional government has made mistakes and handled protest badly. But while the state controls radio and television, numerous anti government newspapers are thriving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Martin Greene, an Irish diplomat based in Addis Ababa, believes the situation has improved dramatically over the past two years. Any assessment must be made within the context of the Mengistu era and the determination of the EPRDF to draw a line in the sand and construct a modern market economy democracy, he says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Government is coming under increasing pressure from the opposition, and even its own backbenchers, to come off the fence and spell out its stance on a future EU defence policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stance en its own Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats know well that little will be given away by the Tanaiste, Mr Spring, in advance o the long promised White Paper, they are both laying down firm markers is this sensitive area. They are, of course, coming from different directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanaiste was challenged in the Foreign Affairs Committee this week to say where he stands on the NATO Partnership for Peace (PFP) which the Government is &quot;considering&quot; joining.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anything with NATO in it is anathema to Fianna Fail. So, apparently, is the Western European Union (WEU) although it was a Fianna Fail dominated government which applied for observer status and which negotiated and signed the Maastricht Treaty which made WEU &quot;an integral part&quot; of the EU and gave it a role when required by member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fianna Fail spokesman on foreign affairs, Mr Ray Burke, tried to steer the Government away from the &quot;militarising&quot; of the EU in next year's Inter Governmental Conference (IGC). For Fianna Fail the emphasis should be on areas where Ireland has expertise, such as peacekeeping and foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal by the party leader, Mr Ahern, to put Irish troops at the disposal of the EU is still on the table, Mr Burke said, but &quot;not through the WEU or the PFP. We should not be involved in the PFP or NATO or any of its organisations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanaiste may have been taken aback to have one of his own backbenchers, Mr Declan Bree, attacking the PFP as &quot;in favour of the nuclear deterrent and completely at variance with our policy&quot;. If this is so, one wonders why the Tanaiste is even wasting time &quot;considering&quot; membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanaiste was obliged to give Mr Bree a little lecture about the PEP. The Government is examining whether membership &quot;would be of benefit to Ireland&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PFP is a series of co operation agreements by non members of NATO with the alliance which can cover areas such as training, rescue missions, drugs detection etc. It has no military function or capacity and so cannot express views on nuclear weapons as a deterrent, he explained to Mr Bree and the committee. Hence &quot;neutrals are able to join&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is this rush of the neutrals such as Austria, Finland and Sweden to join which makes it all the more incomprehensible to Mr Des O'Malley of the PDs and Fine Gael's Mr Alan Shatter why Ireland is hanging back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr O'Malley, the question should be whether Ireland in the PFP &quot;would be of benefit to Europe and the rest of the world and not just to Ireland&quot;. And if 42 countries are now involved, &quot;how can Ireland conceivably stay out?&quot; We may end up being the only European country not involved in the PFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this &quot;heart searching is unnecessary and we should face up to our international responsibilities and not behave in a childish way when it is self evident where lie our duties and responsibilities,&quot; Mr O'Malley insisted. This prompted Mr Bree to comment that Mr O'Malley would only be satisfied &quot;when the panzers are rolling down Westmoreland Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Shatter took the Tanaiste up on another area where he is &quot;considering&quot; what to do. Mr Spring had mentioned that while the Republic is a founder member of the pan European Organisation for Security and Co operation in Europe (OSCE, formerly CSCE), which is increasingly involved in conflict prevention and crisis management, Ireland could not take part in any of its peacekeeping and humanitarian operations as long as legislation allows the Defence Forces to take part only in UN operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Shatter pointed out that now even Russia was joining the PFP, so what was our problem? The Government should bring in the legislation so that when Ireland takes over the presidency of the EU, we do not find ourselves in the position of organising peace keeping operations in which we cannot take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Fianna Fail Tanaiste, Mr Brian Lenihan, also favoured Irish involvement in OSCE operations. &quot;This could head off the pressure to join NATO which is unacceptable to Ireland. The PFP is, I know, a different dimension,&quot; Mr Lenihan said, while not ruling it out as categorically as Mr Burke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the Tanaiste found himself under fire from all quarters. But all will be revealed in his White Paper due later this month or in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As leader of the Labour Party, he has ruled out &quot;full&quot; membership of a military alliance. The programme of the Coalition gives a commitment that there will be a referendum if the IGC comes up with any proposal which would require any change in Ireland's &quot;policy of military neutrality&quot;. But the programme did not rule out future WEU membership as the Fianna Fail Labour one did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine Gael in opposition fought the European elections last year on a platform of &quot;full membership of the WEU&quot;. But all the signs are that Fine Gael is in retreat from what is now probably seen as a foolhardy position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White Paper is likely to call for a closer link with the WEU short of full membership. That way there will be no need for a referendum, and the onus will be on Fianna Fail to get itself off the hook of supporting a treaty which gives the WEU a clear role and at the same time portraying it as a serious threat to neutrality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE cast of Fair City, currently on tour around the country in Mary Halpin's Semi Private, got their comeuppance in Claremorris last week. A number of people walked out during their performance in Claremorris Town Hall, the Connaught Telegraphy reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was insulting and degrading to (women and it was certainly the most obnoxious play I have ever attended in Claremorris,&quot; one &quot;irate member (of the audience&quot; told the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never felt so cheated in all my life,&quot; she added. &quot;And to pay Pounds 16 for the two of us to see what I could only describe as absolute filth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinton visit to Cavan Monaghan likely,&quot; announced the Anglo Celt. &quot;Mr Charles Meissner, the US Assistant Secretary of Commerce who is playing a key role in promoting economic investment in Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties, told a breakfast held in his honour in Monaghan that &quot;it was hoped to include the Border region in the President's itinerary and in that context a visit to Cavan Monaghan would be definitely on Mr Clinton's desk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Princess Diana could soon have an invitation to Co Mayo from the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Mr Kenny, on her desk. The Connaught Telegraph reported that the Minister is &quot;considering renewing&quot; his invitation to the princess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stone of Aran&quot;, as the Connacht Tribune dubbed the American actress Sharon Stone, cycled through the Connemara Gaeltacht to Clifden &quot;totally unnoticed&quot; last week. No one on Inis Mor recognised her either, until they spotted her in the daily newspapers when she was photographed shopping in Galway city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was noticed, however, by a group of schoolgirls with whom she shared a ferry from the island, but she refused to sign autographs or to be photographed with them. Ms Stone was part of a cycling tour of 12 people organised by a local archaeologist, but she and her companion kept to themselves, we were told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actress did not visit the local pubs on Inis Mor - but then what attraction could there possibly be for her there? &quot;West of Ireland Man&quot; is a &quot;beer swilling couch potato&quot;, according to the Connacht Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A health survey by the Irish Heart Foundation found that men in Co Galway are five times more likely than women to watch television for more than four hours a day. Added to the finding that men in Galway drink seven times more than women, &quot;the picture of a man sitting in front of television for hours on end, and with a beer close to hand, begins to emerge,&quot; wrote John Cunningham in the Connacht Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Longford News argued that &quot;a few pints, it appears, does not diminish a man's capacity to lead a nation&quot;. It was referring to the pints downed by the Taoiseach, Mr Bruton, who was in &quot;spectacularly jovial form&quot; after opening the new Pounds 8 million Longford by pass - big news in that part of the world last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a lovely piece, Paul Healy told us that the Taoiseach's laugh made an impression on the gathering and that the Taoiseach and former Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds - who said that if the job had been finished a little quicker he would have opened it himself - shook hands and exchanged friendly words quicker than you could say &quot;Attorney General&quot;,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; or even &quot;vindicated&quot;. &quot;But then the Ballinalee Road is not the Dail, it's part of what we call the real world . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As children thronged around the former Taoiseach for autographs, &quot;a young boy on a bicycle unwittingly made history: the first person to travel on wheels, on the by pass, since its official opening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child abuse was again highlighted in the local newspapers, with the Mid Western Health Board's annual report providing yet more shocking figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian of Nenagh, Co Tipperary, reported a 175 per cent increase in child abuse cases in north Tipperary/east Limerick. The Clare Champion reported that cases in Clare had risen by a massive 600 per cent over the past five years, and the Limerick Leader reported &quot;grave concern&quot; at the news that 478 children had been taken into care last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were a total of 695 reported child abuse cases, only 212 of which had been confirmed, and 26 pregnant girls under the age of 16 had been referred to the social work department of the Regional Maternity Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural Ireland has railed against the closure of sub post offices, small Garda stations and recently 22 ESB shops. Now the parishioners of Robertstown, in Co Kildare, are angry at a decision by their parish priest to do away with Sunday Mass in the village, said the Leinster Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three priests were based in nearby Allen who said a total of nine Masses in Allen, Allenwood, Milltown and Robertstown each week. One of the priests was not replaced on his retirement and so the number of Masses has been cut to five, with Robertstown Mass - which took place in a hotel - cancelled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Try as he will to put a dignified face on it, there is little doubt that the Minister for Finance, Mr Quinn, is going to have to scramble to put the public finances back in order. There is an air of having been caught napping in Ministers' responses over recent days as the scale of the Exchequer's difficulties has become clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may derive from the disparate character of the three party coalition. It may owe something to the natural high spending instincts of leftist parties, as Fianna Fail has jibed. It may be that with the economy going well, some element of hubris has begun to grow up particularly among Labour Ministers. Between one arrangement and another they have been in Government now for quite a while. Maybe John Bruton's minimalist style is showing a down side in lack of control over some departments&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reasons, it is certain that an unacceptable skew has been allowed to develop in public spending. It has already accreted to the point where hoped for tax reliefs have been taken off the agenda and at which productive economic output is being diverted to feed the public service maw, now growing again at a rate which maybe three times that of the overall economy. Mr Quinn yesterday on RTE radio likened his, belated corrective measures to the cost flexing which any financial controller in the private sector has to make. It is a facile comparison and if the Minister believes it himself we are in somewhat worse trouble than we think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For while problems have arisen which ought not to, there is not yet a crisis in the public finances in the sense that there was in the late 1980s. What is discernible is the re emergence of a deadly cycle; economic growth, followed by governmental laxity, a tendency to solve problems by throwing money at them and a consequent demand for more taxation revenue. The cycle can, of course, be broken. And the news before the weekend that the Government is putting control measures in place must in general be welcomed if even greater evils are to be stayed off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragedy of this stop start stop again approach is that it makes planning much more difficult and in some cases virtually impossible. It very often wastes money and it makes for poor quality services for the end user. No better illustration can be given than the peremptory decision to halt the prison development programme which heretofore had been hailed as a solution to the revolving door syndrome and a key element in what passes for the State's criminal justice policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure to develop a coherent response to crime - and in particular to drugs - must represent one of the greatest long term threats to the quality of life in this society. Nothing more than an ad hoc approach has ever been applied and the present Minister, Ms Nora Owen, shows no sign of doing any differently than her predecessors. But even such patch and mend measures as she might have in contemplation are now apparently to be put on hold. To suggest, as Ruairi Quinn does, that possible future vacancies in the gloom of Portlaoise can be a substitute for proper and urgently needed prison accommodation must reflect simple ignorance of the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no way to run an economy. And it is no way to operate the essential services which the community is paying for through its taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir, In her Quidnunc column (May 6th), which I read only recently, Renagh Holohan seems to express doubts concerning the feelings of the new French President towards Ireland. On the contrary, Jacques Chirac could not be better disposed towards the land which welcomed General de Gaulle in 1969. May I recall that he was the first Prime Minister of the French Republic to pay an official visit to Ireland in November 1974. On this occasion, he said this, which is still largely valid today: &quot;I think we have ambitions, interests and preoccupations in common within the Community, a notable example being our attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy. Ever since Ireland's entry into the EEC she has adopted positions similar to ours on the essentials and, when there are differences, on this or that individual question, we do our best to deal with them with the maximum of mutual understanding. But even leaving aside the Community. I think France and Ireland have by virtue of their history, traditions, their similar economic structure, certain cultural ambitions every reason to be close and to understand each other.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacques Chirac made several visits to Ireland alter that and did not fail to make the pilgrimage to Cashel Bay in the West of Ireland, where General de Gaulle spent a few days after his retirement from French politics. When I published my book De Gaulle and Ireland, the new president was one of the first to send me a warm letter of congratulations, praising in particular the parallel drawn between de Valera and de Gaulle. As Prime Minister in 1987 he strongly supported the renovation of the Irish College in Paris, declaring that it &quot;shows Ireland's willingness to maintain a vigorous presence in the heart of our capital&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May I add that the Minister des Anciens Combattants in the new French government is none other than Pierre Pasquini, member of the Free French and former president of the Franco Irish Parliamentary Association of the French National Assembly. In this capacity, he attended the unveiling, in Sneem, by the Tanaiste, Mr Spring, of a memorial stone and plaque to commemorate the 25th anniversary of General de Gaulle's visit to the area. In the autumn of 1993, Pierre Pasquini also welcomed in Paris and in Corsica a delegation of members of the Oireachtas led by Mr Sean Fallon, President of the Seanad. All this confirms that far from ignoring Ireland, the new leaders of France have the knowledge and the goodwill to promote farther the development of the relations between our two countries in every field. Yours, etc.,</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a particular kind of person whose presence evokes an immediate expectation of something interesting about to happen. This is an intangible quality, not easy to define, yet unmistakable when encountered. It is rare and always to be welcomed. Michael McGarry was such a person.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he came into O'Brien's of Sussex Terrace or into Dockers on Sir John Rogerson's Quay - two favourite haunts of the advertising and film industries in which he played so major a role - one knew immediately that the levels of humour and banter and remarkable word play were about to rise rapidly. He was exceptionally good company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remembering him in O'Brien's I think of his observation that the average Irish male enters a bar in accordance with an elaborate, ritualistic procedure. There is the first brief boost of self welcoming confidence followed almost immediately by the paranoid awareness that one is being watched by the as yet unobserved, followed by an attempt at anonymity in the drift towards the counter.  He described this as &quot;hop, skip and sidle&quot; and suggested it as a possible Olympics event at which the Irish would excel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was this kind of thinking that resulted in the huge success of Living with Lynch the legendary radio show that he co wrote with Dermot Doolan. Some of its catch phrases - &quot;You heard it before Joe&quot; - are still in circulation. It is to be found in Irish Wild Life, a column that he contributed to the Sunday Independent and, notably, in and how to understand them, the only book that he published, in which his skill as a caricaturist is also in evidence. But, to his friends, it is probably the anarchic brilliance of his talk that remains most memorable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had a distinguished career in advertising, bringing to the campaigns on which he worked a quirky individuality. In the early days of RTE when second and third rate English production companies were making mediocre commercials for the new medium, he was one of the first to perceive the need for an indigenous industry. Almost all of the crews and technical staff now working in that industry are happy to acknowledge that they are in his debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a producer, for Peter Owens Ltd where he was Creative Director, and later as a director with Maunsell McGarry, the production company that he formed with his friend, the late Creagh Maunsell, he worked on commercials of consistently high quality observing the foibles of characters with a benignly humorous eye. Amongst his many other interests was a passion for athletic achievement. As a young man he had been a fine track athlete and he had an encyclopaedic knowledge of records and achievements. He deplored the grudging attitude with which many Irish athletes were regarded and was particularly irked at the inadequate recognition of Earn on Coughlan's success. Athletics was one of the very few areas in which humour deserted him and he would speak with intense conviction, an unexpected facet of this many faceted man. The very large attendance at his funeral testified to the sense of loss experienced by everyone who knew him and an anxiety to share in the loss of Ann and of his daughters and sons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are several encouraging signs that the war in Bosnia could be closer to a diplomatic resolution as a result of more decisive and robust responses by the international powers involved in the search for a settlement. The Anglo French creation of a joint rapid deployment force and the dramatic US rescue of the US airforce pilot Captain Scott O'Grady point in this direction. So does the appointment of the Swedish politician, Mr Carl Bildt, as the European Union's mediator to succeed Dr David Owen. President Clinton's determination not to follow the advice of the House of Representatives by unilaterally dropping the Bosnian arms embargo keeps open the diplomatic pressure on the Serbs to settle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether these promising signs of increased concern and activity do indeed translate into a settlement acceptable to the warring parties will now depend on whether these powers can also assert themselves in favour of an outcome that more firmly reflects the rights and wrongs of the conflict as well as their overwhelming consensus that it must be contained. Too strict a separation between these two objectives has so far bedevilled their involvement. It has led to a facile definition of the conflict as a civil war rather than a war of aggression initiated mainly by the Serbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has, of course, made the containment objective easier to justify. But it has also helped to distort &quot;the precise mandates applying to United Nations involvement in ex Yugoslavia.  Conventionally these are referred to as &quot;peace keeping&quot; rather than &quot;peace enforcing&quot; ones. In fact they come under the enforcement provisions outlined in Chapter VII of the UN Charter, specifically Article 42, although they are tied to specific tasks such as protecting safe areas, delivering humanitarian aid and enforcing no fly zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often UN commanders in the field and governments of the main troop providers have been reluctant to face domestic opprobrium on the issue of casualties. They have opportunistically disguised the importance of this mandate - and their responsibility to apply it against Bosnian Serb harassment and aggression. The equal reluctance of the UN Secretary General, Dr Boutros Ghali, to assume responsibility for enforcing these mandates has contributed greatly to the world organisation's loss of credibility both in Bosnia and internationally in its handling of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greater the justice of the settlement reached in Bosnia the greater will be the ability to contain it. If the more robust international resolve now on display is asserted effectively it can contribute to resolving the Bosnian conflict. In order to do so it should be tilted in the direction of militarily enforcing the UN mandates against resistance by the Bosnian Serbs. Diplomatically it should be directed towards increasing the pressure on the Milosevic regime in Belgrade, in co operation with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be plenty of opportunity in coming weeks to co ordinate this activity diplomatically, as EU and US leaders meet in Washington before the Group of Seven summit in Nova Scotia and the EU Council meets in Cannes. But unless they are willing to join military and political determination to a readiness to see justice done to the state of Bosnia their efforts are likely to be in vain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE Irish&nbsp;economy will have to be at the peak of competitive efficiency if it is to cope with the demands of the next stage of economic and monetary union in Europe, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC) has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also said that the EU should not be expanded further until at least the year 2000 and has urged the Government to carry out a study on the broad implications of enlargement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a wide ranging report on Ireland, the EU and economic integration from a business perspective, IBEC says there is currently no clear evidence as to where the balance of advantage lies for Irish industry on enlargement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, written by Mr Peter Brennan, the organisation's director of European and international affairs, says the Government should be completely satisfied before the decision is taken to proceed to a single currency, that every possible initiative has been taken to achieve the required level of competitiveness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brennan says the Government should prepare a White Paper on Ireland's competitive position &quot;as a matter of some urgency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report predicts a 1999 start up for monetary union, but warns of a need to keep both the option of going in and staying out open, given the importance of the monetary links with the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urges the Government to &quot;take every possible step to keep the UK at the centre of the debate on European integration&quot;, and emphasises the references in the Northern Ireland Framework Document to the need to develop a common approach and arrangements on the island of Ireland to EU issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report specifically attacks proposals made in the last month by the Irish Commissioner for Social Affairs, Mr Padraig Flynn, to incorporate legally enforceable social rights in a new European treaty. It also strongly opposes Parliament proposals to extend both the competence of the EU to health issues and to curb the right of the Social Partners to a special place in the decision making structure of the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Irish employers do not want any further regulation of the labour market at EU level, &quot;the report says. &quot;Ideally there should be a moratorium on new legislation.&quot; And IBEC welcomes both the limited scope of the current Social Action Programme and Mr Flynn's personal commitment that the period ahead will be one of consolidation rather than new legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it rejects the constitutional incorporation of social rights, IBEC does call for the &quot;imperative of competitiveness&quot; to be written into the new Treaty as an overriding principal. &quot;It should be on a par with EMU and the EU's social dimension, the report says.  &quot;This proposal, if accepted, would require that all new legislation emanating from the EU would seek to improve Europe's competitive deficit,&quot; it adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Irish GDP now well in excess of the 75 per cent of EU average which is the cut off point for Objective I status - the definition for structural fund purposes of less developed regions - the report acknowledges a particular need to prepare for a reduction of the EU contribution to Ireland's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It warns against what it sees as an unsustuinable growth in Government spending and argues that the public will have to be convinced that there is more to the EU than budgetary transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although defending the need for the Commission to retain its central role as initiator of legislation in the EU, IBEC calls for its structures to be reformed - &quot;it must be accountable and run like a business, rather than the bureaucracy it has become.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report urges modification of the EU's cumbersome decision making procedures, both through simplification and the reduction in veto voting. It also expresses reservations about extra powers at this stage for the European Parliament, &quot;now the most dynamic of the Union's Institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBEC advocates putting off the key decisions faced by next year's Inter Governmental Conference (IGC) to a later conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU needs several more years of reflection, debate and analysis before Maastricht Mark II is submitted for popular endorsement,&quot; the report concludes. It sees next year's IGC as an opportunity for no more than &quot;technical adjustments to the treaty to allow for enlargement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IGC should also consider scrapping existing treaties and their replacement with a short new constitution for the EU, it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBEC makes a strong case for urgent work on a new Transatlantic Treaty between the EU and the US that would encompass free trade, economic and monetary co operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is to acquire Lotus Development in a friendly buyout worth $ 3.52 billion (Pounds 2.2 billion). The deal is the largest merger in software history and began life as a hostile bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM employs over 300 people in its various operations in Ireland and spends up to Pounds 100 million per annum buying components from other Irish suppliers for its own products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lotus operation in Ireland, employs around 400 people, has been based in Santry in Dublin for the past 10 years and is involved in software development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lotus, which is also the world's third largest software company, agreed to be bought by IBM for $ 64 (Pounds 40) a share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreed share price was $ 4 higher (Pounds 2.50) than what IBM offered when it launched a hostile takeover attempt last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM is now positioned to take on Microsoft and change the landscape of the software industry, according to analysts. Microsoft employs 900 people in Ireland at its European headquarters in Dublin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the bid was initially formalised last week, IBM chairman Mr Louis Gerstner said it would enable the leading computer maker to respond to consumer demand for more compatible computer hardware and software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is clear to me and many others that the industry is now entering a new phase, in which all the computing power is linked together,&quot; said Mr Gerstner, who led the computer giant through a two year restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year IBM posted profits of $ 2.9 billion (Pounds 1.8 billion) or $ 5.02 per share (Pounds 3.13).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In taking over Lotus, IBM has acquired Lotus Notes, a new generation of software that allows people to share data, images and sound on a network of personal computers linked to a powerful data bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lotus Notes offers IBM a unique opportunity to challenge Microsoft in tomorrow's markets by linking PCs to powerful mainframe computers that traditionally have been IBM's domain, according to analysts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IBM can potentially change the competitive landscape of the software industry,&quot; said International Data Corporation (IDC), one of the leading analysts in the computer industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft chairman, Mr Bill Gates said last week that it was too early to say what the bid would mean for Microsoft.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE STOCK Exchange is planning a new listing designed to aid the development of small and medium sized companies. The Developing Companies Market will be based on a package of tax incentives currently being negotiated with the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the general manager of the Stock Exchange, Mr Tom Healy, it intends to learn from the existing, but unsuccessful, Small Companies Market. &quot;The experiment of the late 1980s hasn't been successful. The Small Companies Market is still there, but it hasn't attracted many companies.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most countries in the European Union developed a second tier market in the late 1980s,&quot; he said. &quot;Most Exchanges are now either abandoning them or winding them down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the establishment of the Developing Companies Market, the Small Companies Market will be abandoned, he said, adding that companies already listed there, such as the Sunday Tribune, are likely to be given a main listing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stock market finds it difficult to facilitate the smaller companies. The structure we have seems best suited to the larger ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, he said, smaller companies attempting to raise finance on the Exchange face two problems. The level of reporting necessary can be cumbersome and investors, in particular institutional investors, are wary of putting money in what are considered high risk investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This leads, he said, to an equity gap. In the early stages financing may be available from agencies such as Forbairt. In the later stages companies can obtain a full listing. According to Mr Healy, the new market plans to bridge the gap between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emphasising that no details had yet been agreed, Mr Healy said that &quot;some of the tax incentives available for the Developing Companies Market will be similar to the BES.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incentives will be for investor rather than companies.  According to Mr Healy, however, institutions are unlikely to be the main source of potential investors. &quot;The key thing is to try to get the private investor,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the particulars have not yet being worked out, members of the new market are likely to be small Irish companies which have not yet being quoted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;CHANGE in aspects of the Republic which reflect its Catholic ethos would help make Northern Presbyterians more open to it. The more secular the South would be, the easier it would be for Northern Presbyterians to relate to its ethos,&quot; says the new Presbyterian Moderator, Dr John Ross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 59-year-old minister in Holywood, Co Down, thinks that more contact between North and South is the best way to change the almost total identification of Presbyterianism with unionism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel the tragedy of Ireland, between Catholics and Protestants, and the tragedy between Ireland and Britain, very deeply&quot;, he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stresses that it is &quot;natural&quot; for Presbyterians, as British citizens of Northern Ireland, to want to retain their British identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most would find it hard to see their British identity within an all-Ireland context. No Christian of any political persuasion should ever put their aspirations before their allegiance to Christ, but a desire to be either a unionist or a nationalist is perfectly legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said last week's General Assembly had been &quot;very interested&quot; in the contribution by the minister at Lucan, Dr Trevor Morrow, who pointed out how heterogeneous the Republic had become, and the inaccuracy of the Northern perception that it was still dominated by &quot;Celtic myth and Anglophobia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ross repeats his church's criticisms of the Framework Document: that it is too unbalanced and slanted in a &quot;green&quot; direction, and that the institutions it proposes would be &quot;cumbersome and unworkable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admits that the present period of &quot;cessation of violence&quot; - but not yet an assured peace - is very confusing to Presbyterians. Some of them &quot;might have felt less threatened by IRA violence than by the present political pressures and uncertainties. You could see the enemy then and you were against it. So many people don't know where they are now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a strong supporter of the Evangelical Contribution on Northern Ireland (ECONI) group, which urges Presbyterians and other evangelicals to fife up to the problems of injustice, sectarianism and relationships with Catholics. &quot;I have nothing but admiration for ECONI's open, thoughtful, Christian approach. I'd like to see their publications widely read and applied throughout the island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stresses that there is a wide range of opinion in the Presbyterian Church about what is the appropriate relationship to have with the Catholic Church, and &quot;each minister has the freedom to do what he feels is right before God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike his predecessor, Dr David McGaughey, he has no problem in worshipping with Catholics. The parish priest of Holywood, Father John Stewart, is a friend, and they share in acts of &quot;community&quot; worship like joint services at Christmas to raise money for cancer research. Father Stewart was present at the opening of the General Assembly this week as Dr Ross's personal guest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Moderator believes that the deep divisions of the 1970s and early 1980s over membership of the World Council of Churches are largely over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points out that they were underpinned by a perception among many Northern Presbyterians that the WCC was supporting guerrilla groups in southern Africa, which made it difficult for them to deal with the matter objectively because of their own sufferings at the hands of the IRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He himself was a missionary in Malawi when the area was being decolonised in the early 1960s. &quot;My experience in Africa makes me very wary of any simplistic notion that when you get rid of one system of government you will find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a similarly simplistic notion here that everything wrong is due to Britain or the Stormont parliament, and if you got rid of them everything would be paradise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the people he admires - and he stresses that &quot;many people who have made contributions to bringing about a new day in this land are never mentioned or have their faces seen&quot; - are Cardinal Daly and the former Presbyterian moderator, Dr Jack Weir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would he like to achieve in his year in office? &quot;I would like to build bridges, and through personal contact seek to remove misunderstandings and build trust between Presbyterians and Catholics.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AT A weekend seminar in Dublin, a senior UN official working in Burundi questioned the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Abdel Aziz, who is senior political adviser and deputy representative to the UN Secretary-General in Bujumbura, said he did not believe in peacekeeping operations. &quot;They are too costly, and they do not maintain the peace afterwards,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He does believe, however, that UN forces should be ready &quot;in cases of major conflagration, to prevent extremes of conflict&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the UN is to continue,&quot; he said, &quot;new articles based on clear criteria must be prepared, to create a system of preventive diplomacy within the UN and the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar on &quot;The Politics of Famine: Ireland, Europe, and Overseas Aid,&quot; which was hosted by the Labour MEP, Ms Bernie Malone, was also addressed by the Minister of State for development co-operation, Ms Joan Burton, the British MEP, Ms Glenys Kinnock, Ms Mary Sutton of Trocaire, and Ms Lynn Cassel, counsellor at the US embassy in Dublin. The afternoon session was chaired by Dr Miriam Hederman O'Brien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introducing the seminar, Ms Malone said the EU's Common Agricultural Policy was having &quot;an absolutely devastating effect on developing economies&quot; and used up over 50 per cent of the EU budget.  She said the money would have a more positive effect if spent on programmes of urban and rural renewal, and she called for &quot;a radical overhaul of Europe's agricultural policies and for the establishment of a policy that pays due regard to our obligations to our fellow human beings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of State, Ms Joan Burton, said that the forthcoming White Paper on foreign policy would put a special emphasis on improving the Government's response to humanitarian emergencies, and on direct support for food security. With the rate of increase in population there was no issue more urgent for the future of the world than access to food, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She drew attention to the parallels between the portrayal of Irish people during the Famine in the London media as &quot;lacking adequacy&quot;, with similar portrayals of famine-hit peoples in the western media today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Kinnock spoke of &quot;the need to work for mutual growth, mutual respect across the world&quot;. She said it was easy to make a moral case for this, but that it was also a matter of self-interest. She linked the AIDS epidemic, the growth in the narcotics trade, and religious fundamentalism to poverty in the developing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of aid on offer from Europe was &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, she said, and she was &quot;sorry and ashamed&quot; to say that Britain was &quot;at the vanguard&quot; of the opposition to increasing aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was also critical of the availability of arms in Africa. &quot;The five members of the UN Security Council sell 85 per cent of the world's arms,&quot; she pointed out, &quot;two-thirds of which are sold to the poorest countries. &quot;But she advised the attendance not to despair.  &quot;Feel angry,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mary Sutton of Trocaire pointed to the correlation between the existence of democratic structures and a free media in a country and a lack of famines. She said that famine was not an act of God, nor of some set of economic and ecological malfunctions. &quot; In essence people do not starve,&quot; Ms Sutton said, &quot;rather they are forced to starve&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEADINGLEY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAY WHAT you like about English cricket, but nowhere else is tradition so faithfully observed. Jacket and tie in the Lord's Long Room, Dickie Bird peering manically at his light meter, Fred Trueman not quite comprehending what is going off out there, and England getting routinely stuffed in the opening Test match of the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lest we forget, the West Indian side which knocked off England by nine wickets in the equivalent of less than three days playing time, arrived in England as a recently beaten side, chronically short of confidence, no opening batsmen, over the hill fast bowlers, and a mentally washed out captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when you are in this kind of disrepair there is no more potent medicine than a few games of cricket against England, who will presumably adopt their customary policy of eventually winning a Test match somewhere, hut not until the series is comfortably beyond them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weather has almost been as foul as England themselves over the past four days, forcing Raymond Illingworth ever deeper inside his sheepskin coat, and prompting one journalist to refer to him as looking like a &quot;Third Division football manager.&quot; Yesterday the chairman said: &quot;I don't mind the football manager. It's the Third Division bit I object to.&quot; Illy did not make it clear whether he regarded the inference that England were Third Division was a bit harsh or unwarranted flattery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Illingworth needed the coat to stop him shivering, he would have presumably have worn it even in a heatwave. It is not much good, as the chairman conceded, occupying the crease against the West Indies without playing a few shots, but England's batting in this match (with the notable exception of the captain) was about as technically proficient as someone attempting to eliminate a wasp with a rolled up newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Illingworth, another downside of the weather came yesterday when he was grilled on TV about his batsmen's lack of discipline. As his interrogator was David Gower, he presumably felt that this was a bit rich, but even Gower would have blushed at some of England's ludicrous strokeplay in this game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While England's form graph continues its journey towards the earth's core, they are still unbeatable opposition in the interview room. &quot;If we had got 300 in the first innings it would have been a much tighter match&quot; was the captain's view afterwards, and this, of course, is unarguable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they had made 600, or 1,000, or 10,000 it would have been even closer still, and once the rules are amended to award a run for every &quot;if&quot; in a team's vocabulary, England will he very hard to beat indeed. Illingworth's comment that England &quot;have got to improve&quot; was a similarly impressive entry in the stating the obvious category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is fatuous to suggest that England were wholly responsible for their own downfall, in that the West Indies' attack was always dangerous on a pitch that bounced extravagantly at times and is a far more dangerous unit than Australia encountered earlier in the year, now that Ian Bishop is available again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Bishop back in the side, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose (who took his 100th wicket in 19 Tests against England when he re-arranged Devon Malcolm's stumps) now have someone with which to share the workload, and Bishop - named man of the match here - also has the priceless ability to move the ball around at dangerous speeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">England also got a couple of things right in selection, in that Peter Martin and Richard Illingworth both turned in decent bowling performances, but the selectors may not be in much of a self-congratulatory mood over the experiment of opening the batting with Robin Smith, asking Alec Stewart to combine two specialist roles and preferring Devon Malcolm to Angus Fraser on Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After England's second innings finally expired for 205 in midafternoon yesterday, leaving the West Indies to make 126 to win, Malcolm was deemed too expensive to risk with the new ball, and was put out to grass while Martin, Illingworth and Phillip DeFreitas nagged away with good old fashioned English line and length. This was so effective, that the West Indies could only crawl to 70 off 11 overs by tea, and eventually required no less than 19 overs to make their 126.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was for the loss of Sherwin Campbell, brilliantly caught by Atherton at third slip, but Carl Hooper and Brian Lara were in such rampant form that no-one could bowl to them. Hooper's 74 came from only 72 deliveries, and 60 of them - including four sixes - came in boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">England led by only 26 with six wickets in hand when play resumed an hour late yesterday, and it required a long partnership between Graham Thorpe and Mark Ramprakash. Sadly, Ramprakash was out cheaply for the second time in the game, and he now averages only 19.25 in his 6 Test matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, England did not come remotely close to setting the West Indies a target that might have made them nervous. What makes England nervous is that the next match is at Lord's, where they traditionally make performances like this one seem rather good.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A BEAUTIFUL afternoon in Carrick-on-Shannon provided for around 4,000 spectators a sad epilogue to one of last year's great sporting stories. Leitrim, 12 months ago crowned provincial champions for the first time in 67 years, lost their title in injury time of yesterday's semi-final of the Connacht football championship, sponsored by the Bank of Ireland, against Galway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an abrupt end to a memorable year was made even more traumatic by the manner of the defeat. After dominating possession for virtually the entire second hall, thanks largely to a peerless display by veteran Mickey Quinn at centre field and despite a stiff enough breeze, Leitrim kicked away their chances with a combination of tactical ineptitude and woeful finishing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their compression between the 40s helped set up the centre field domination but left them stretched at the back and denuded in the full forward line where a succession of second-half deliveries fell harmlessly into a no-man's land, occasionally patrolled by Galway's defenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galway, conversely, having been under the cosh, emerged for the endgame to pick off the necessary points with an ease that must have broken the hearts of John O'Mahony and his fellow Leitrim mentors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides had put in an earnest afternoon's effort - more marked by atleticism and stamina than by silky skills - but there was no doubting that Leitrim appeared to have done enough to keep on course for the defence of their title. Having finally pulled away, they were two points clear with less than five minutes left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well-taken points from either wing by Jarlath Fallon and Sean de Paor - roaming unhindered from half back - levelled, the scores and then, into injury time, Niall Finnegan, whose performance in the right corner up to that point hadn't exactly been nerveless, kicked a free from around 35 metres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leitrim had had no serious action in months whereas Galway had played two vigorous matches against Sligo in the preceding fortnight.  Sharpness didn't look a factor all the way through but when a team loses by a point, no consider at ions can be discounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, it was - as John O Mahony lamented afterwards - just this sort of claustrophobic match in which Leitrim had patented their formula for tightly- scraped wins. He went as far as to say that yesterday's was the best football that Leitrim had played in their last three years of playing Galway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galway threw the early shapes by controlling centre field and their forwards - all flicks and dodges - whizzed around, giving off a menacing drone and exposing Leitrim's defence for pace. But by the 11th minute, it was all square at 0-3 to 0-3 and the initial threat had subsided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leitrim were playing with the benefit of the breeze but struggled to exploit it. It was evident that Liam Conlon and Padraig McLoughlin had the jump on Seamus Fallon and John Kilraine but again, insufficient damage was inflicted on the back of this advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McLoughlin was put through by Colin McGlynn in the ninth minute only to see his poorly directed shot well saved by McGinley. That Declan Darcy kicked the resulting '45' was scant compensation for the loss of psychological edge that a goal would have brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galway suffered the setback of seeing the influential Kevin Walsh being replaced because of a rib injury after 25 minutes, but they battled away, demonstrating the economy that would ultimately win them the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One straw in the wind, just before half-time, was the place-kicking form of captain, Declan Darcy whose acumen from frees and '45s' had been crucial in the county's progress last year, began to exhibit signs of malfunction and was to finish the afternoon with four wides from what he would presumably judge as kickable positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes, the second half was into its pattern. Leitrim threw up a wall in the middle and the ball always seemed to be rebounding back off it and monotonously progressing towards the Galway goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the waste - the six first-half wides total was doubled before the end - Leitrim made what appeared the decisive break in the 28th and 29th minutes when penetrative running by substitutes Aidan Rooney and Ciaran McGovern yielded points for Paul Kieran and McGovern himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit is due to Galway for their husbandry. They kicked only half the number of wides recorded by the profligate losers and were able to draw down impressive points when most needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Val Daly contributed well from centre forward, a role into which; he was switched from early on, and he cleverly directed play when his centre field was sending any through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jarlath Fallon shone in patches which confirmed both his skills and inconsistency, but the outstanding player on the winners' team was de Paor whose classical talents have long been hidden under the cloak of darkness covering his county's fortunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often moved around the positions - depending on the team's requirements - his best position is wing back and he showed fine touches yesterday for his two points, including the one that tied up the match, before the winning free.</SPAN></P>
