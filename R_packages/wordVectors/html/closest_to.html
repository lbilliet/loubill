<h2>Return the n closest words in a VectorSpaceModel to a given vector.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a convenience wrapper around the most common use of
'cosineSimilarity'; the listing of several words similar to a given vector.
Unlike cosineSimilarity, it returns a data.frame object instead of a matrix.
cosineSimilarity is more powerful, because it can compare two matrices to
each other; closest_to can only take a vector or vectorlike object as its second argument.
But with (or without) the argument n=Inf, closest_to is often better for
plugging directly into a plot.
</p>
<p>As with cosineSimilarity, the second argument can take several forms. If it's a vector or
matrix slice, it will be taken literally. If it's a character string, it will
be interpreted as a word and the associated vector from 'matrix' will be used. If
a formula, any strings in the formula will be converted to rows in the associated 'matrix'
before any math happens.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
closest_to(matrix, vector, n = 10, fancy_names = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or VectorSpaceModel</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>vector</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector (or a string or a formula coercable to a vector)
of the same length as the VectorSpaceModel. See below.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of closest words to include.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fancy_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>If true (the default) the data frame will have descriptive names like
'similarity to &quot;king+queen-man&quot;'; otherwise, just 'similarity.' The default can speed up
interactive exploration.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A sorted data.frame with columns for the words and their similarity
to the target vector. (Or, if as_df==FALSE, a named vector of similarities.)
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

# Synonyms and similar words
closest_to(demo_vectors,demo_vectors[["good"]])

# If 'matrix' is a VectorSpaceModel object,
# you can also just enter a string directly, and
# it will be evaluated in the context of the passed matrix.

closest_to(demo_vectors,"good")

# You can also express more complicated formulas.

closest_to(demo_vectors,"good")

# Something close to the classic king:man::queen:woman;
# What's the equivalent word for a female teacher that "guy" is for
# a male one?

closest_to(demo_vectors,~ "guy" - "man" + "woman")
