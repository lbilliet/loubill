<<<<<<< HEAD
Today’s performance by the Minister for Finance has really been like a Hallowe’en B movie. For Fianna Fáil, it is really “Nightmare on Merrion Street” with mood music from the shower scene in “Psycho”.

This is a tough budget for middle-income and working families, just like the Government promised. Middle-class and working families have not just taken a hit, they have been mugged by the Minister. Whether we are referring to the income levy or the restriction in terms of health costs, we should make no mistake about the fact that the coping classes, the PAYE sector, are the Minister’s main targets today. While this budget will eat into the income of the average PAYE family, the ultra-wealthy, the tax exiles and those who made a killing from the Celtic tiger will suffer relatively little pain. I noted how the Minister thought about them when he introduced the levy of €10 for people leaving the country but I noticed how he managed to exempt those friends of Fianna Fáil with private jets. The levy does not apply to craft that carry fewer than 20 passengers. If the girls want a weekend in New York, as people got used to in the Celtic tiger years, and want to avoid paying the €10, they had better talk to a friend with a private aircraft.

The budget reeks of panic measures. The Minister lacks a clear and coherent strategy for economic recovery in the medium term. I worry about the quality of the figures in the budget. No fewer than three very reputable commentators and economic firms indicated the Minister is overestimating the tax take for next year by up to €3 billion. His plan is very limited and very reminiscent of the Haughey budgets of the early 1980s, during which era there was a broad indication that line Ministers would reduce costs by specific targets. However, it never really happened. It was not until Ray MacSharry became Minister for Finance some years later that there was real implementation of cutbacks in regard to targeted spending.

The Minister should have delivered a recovery plan to put the 80,000 unemployed back to work, training or education. On page B.15 of the Budget Statement, the Minister indicates eight very severe restrictions to entitlement to welfare payments. This will mean that many people, who through no fault of their own are losing their jobs in the current economic climate, will be subject to many more restrictions and will have to wait many more weeks to receive a benefit. When they receive it, their qualification period will be reduced.

There is nothing in the budget to get the 80,000 on the dole back to work, education and training. When I was in the Department of Social Welfare with the Minister’s former ministerial colleague, Deputy Michael Woods, I introduced the back-to-work allowance and a series of other measures to get people off social welfare and back into employment. This budget contains no such positive measures.

What a bonfire of the vanities we have witnessed today. Very little has been spared. Into the bonfire goes the national development plan and many of our most ambitious plans for a proper transport system. There is no mention of metro north, metro west or a train to Navan, but the roads programme has been kept.

Into the bonfire goes the Fianna Fáil manifesto and all it promised. Into the bonfire goes most of Fianna Fáil’s commitments to a fair society and social justice. One of the monuments to children and women that the Celtic tiger should have built — because we worked for it — was a proper child care and pre-school education system. Instead, the Minister indicated that he really intends, in future budgets while the recession continues, to take the axe to child care and child benefit. This represents a bad day for many women in Ireland, be they full-time carers of children in the home or working outside the home and trying to mix work with child care. We should have built a pre-education and pre-school system because all of our competi[455]tors in Europe, whom we aspire to be like, have one. We had the money during the boom but did not build it.

The Government has driven the economy into the ditch. Today we have the first full view of the wreckage and our first full opportunity to estimate the cost of the repair. Believe me, the wreckage is not a pretty sight and the repair bill will leave every taxpayer gasping. No doubt Ministers will congratulate themselves on their tough-love approach. However, will the Taoiseach be able to look in the eye a family whose livelihood has been destroyed by his economic mismanagement and say to it, in the style of Bill Clinton, “I feel your pain”? Like hell he will. Those on the Government benches will feel very little pain over the measures announced today; they are too well cushioned for that.

The levy the Minister introduced will mean extra income tax of €500 or €600 for those earning €50,000 or €60,000 per annum. Such a family does not merit a doctor-only medical card or a full one but many such families must often pay for treatment for really serious medical conditions. If they want to go to an accident and emergency unit, they must now pay €100, an increase from €66. If they must pay privately for a fast operation to save the life of an elderly parent in the absence of a medical card, as many now do to avoid queues, they will find the tax refund to which they were entitled heretofore has been reduced to 20%. I ask the Minister to rethink this before the introduction of the Finance Bill.

There are many well-documented cases of families taking second mortgages on houses to pay for expensive private medical care because it is not otherwise available or because, for one reason or another, their health insurance coverage or that of their parents is not intact. They will take a very heavy hit in today’s budget. The Minister has not thought through the consequences of this for the complex arrangements families make to support themselves and their loved ones when their private medical insurance does not cover them or when their only option is to go to a private institution not included in their insurance plan. For years, we have heard talk about soft and hard landings. The Taoiseach assured us time and again that we would have a soft landing. The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is the Taoiseach’s trusted pilot but the Minister does not know the territory and he is carrying tonnes of excess baggage. There is a heavy fog, it is pitch dark outside and he has not a clue where to make a landing, either hard or soft.

This is a budget that compounds the conditions it was meant to address. It does nothing to stem the haemorrhage of jobs, it abandons a long-held policy of having little or no borrowing for current spending and it puts important capital projects like public transport on the long finger at the time we should be preparing the country to take advantage of any recovery. Everywhere we look, the economic news is troubling. While it took Ministers a long time to come to terms with that cold reality, for many of our people it is not really news. They have been paying the price for months, even if the Taoiseach failed to notice.

Some 80,000 workers have lost their jobs this year, the largest annual increase ever recorded. Official records show that there are 110,000 children living in poverty. It has never been more difficult to save or to retire and thousands of pensioners have to choose between food and fuel because the rising price of both is not matched by either their pension or their fuel allowance. I welcome the increase of €2 in the fuel allowance, which is great.

The Minister knows that in our joint constituency, even in a cheap shop, a bag of coal costs approximately €17. He could have acceded to the request of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which works at the coalface, to have at least doubled the fuel allowance, which would have only taken another €6.

[456]Across Ireland, young people have to come to terms with a reality that their parents never thought would return. In the coming five to six weeks, thousands of young men and women and their proud parents will go to graduation ceremonies in universities and institutes of technology all over Ireland. Many will have failed to get jobs since they left college or will have stop-gap temporary jobs. Many graduates of earlier years — engineers, architects, scientists, accountants, surveyors and solicitors — have been let go during the past month. The best brains of a generation will feel as if the dream that so many have hoped for is slowly slipping away.

It has been an interesting three months for the two Brians. It has been interesting to watch both of them respond so belatedly to the new economic reality. They sat on their hands all summer until it was too late. Their first reaction to this crisis was traditional bluster, with the same old tired line over and over again: “The fundamentals of our economy are strong.” In the same way, the bank regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank used to say: “The fundamentals of our banking system are strong.” Every unemployed worker would love to have a euro for every time he or she heard that dreary slogan all through the spring and summer as jobs were lost and the banking crisis moved inevitably to a long-predicted meltdown.

I have every confidence we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. The whole world knows the Irish are a resilient race. One lesson we should learn is that we cannot steer ourselves out of this situation by heading in the same direction with the same failed policies. I do not fault the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for all the problems we are facing now, but I fault his delay in waking up to their existence and his tardy response. I fault the economic philosophy the Government has slavishly followed for the past 11 years. It is a philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down. It is a philosophy that says even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise. It is a philosophy that lets vested interests — the speculators, the developers and the bankers — dictate our country’s economic policy, so it worked for them instead of for our people. Let us be clear. What we have seen in the past few months is nothing less than the final verdict on this philosophy, a philosophy that completely failed the most basic stress test.

A Government less given to vanity and to lecturing the rest of the world on the brilliance of its economic achievements would have seen the dangers and prepared for them. The economy has become seriously unbalanced on the watch of the Taoiseach and the Minister. Basically, after months reassuring everyone that things were under control, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, now says the sky is falling and that to save the world we have to do exactly what he says. Why should we respect his word today? I heard his party constituency colleague, Deputy Sean Fleming, state on “Prime Time” last week that the people who led us into this mess are not the people to lead us out of it. He meant the failed bankers, but his words are no less pertinent with regard to the Taoiseach and his Ministers.

This budget is the legacy of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, to Irish families. The true cost will hang like a millstone around the necks of our people for years to come. The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to international events as though the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, was simply the victim of international events rather than being very culpable in regard to matters such as the property bubble. It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that created the costly decentralisation fiasco. It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that created the HSE fiasco — we are paying McKinsey consultants millions of euro to undo that Micheál Martin monument to bad governance. It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that made the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, continue to inflate the property bubble with tax breaks when every single warning shouted stop. It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that made the public finances so utterly dependent on an overheating house building sector.

[457]I want to put one question to the Minister and I hope it will not bewilder him. I am sure he and the Taoiseach would want to be remembered not just for economic success, however elusive that seems in present circumstances, but also for a progressive record in advancing social justice, so let him answer the following simple question. After 12 years in power, why is income inequality still so deep and why is wealth inequality in assets worse than when the Government took office?

The Government has invented more tax breaks in a decade for the rich than their accountants can keep up with. It is a Government which has presided over a widening, not a narrowing, of inequalities of personal wealth. The top 1% now own more of the nation’s wealth than they ever did. Property and land speculators have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Government’s terms in power but the Government coaxed them on, regardless of the consequences.

I note the Minister reduced the top rate of stamp duty on commercial property from 9% to 6%. In a falling commercial market, there is merit in this but, at the same time, why did he not pay attention to the young couple stuck in their first house but who cannot afford to trade up? Why always go after the commercial interests of the big property developers?

One of the reasons we are not creating more businesses in this economy is the cost of rents. Most major commercial property is owned by the same large group of developers who have dominated Fianna Fáil’s economic philosophy. The rents they charge are astronomical, but there is nothing in the budget that insists that property developers begin bringing rents down so that young people who want to start businesses can pay a reasonable and affordable rent.

At the outset, the Minister referred to the bank situation. To recall a phrase uttered by a colleague of his — I nearly said “former colleague”— Boston and Berlin now have one thing in common. They are both nationalising or part-nationalising their banks. It appears inevitable the Government will have to provide some mechanism to allow banks and financial institutions to recapitalise. If that is to be done it must be based on one clear proviso. The people will support decisions made by the Government to salvage the principal elements of the banking system but the Government and taxpayers must get what people who provide capital are entitled to, namely, a share in ownership so that all the gains of a successful rescue plan do not go to the people who made the mess in the first place but back to the taxpayers who made significant sacrifices to calm the situation down and rescue it.

The banks have to be made fit for purpose. We need to take a back-to-basics approach to the banking sector. The reformed financial system, built by the Government and paid for by the taxpayer, needs to be plain and old fashioned. In the United States it is called “plain vanilla finance”. The banking system should be restored to its traditional role of supplying credit to the real economy, with as few complications or fancy products as possible. We need a system in which retail banks accept savings and make loans for regular businesses, large and small, and regular mortgages for families around the country, and where the complexity of financial products is strictly limited and subject to the kind of independent safety tests associated with new drugs or cars. That is serious hard-touch regulation and citizens will rightly insist on it as the price of any further rescue package.

Despite the huge rise in the budget deficit and the many spending cuts and tax increases outlined by the Minister, the budget’s impact will probably be overshadowed in the next ten years by further tax increases to pay for bank bailouts. The Minister has said the unnecessarily wide-ranging bank guarantee will not cost taxpayers anything. He is wrong and taxpayers will pay the price for his, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen’s, misjudgments.

The budget brings back many unhappy memories of an era we hoped would never return. One nasty feature of that era, which we only discovered years later through the tribunals, was the hidden offshore accounts. We remember Ansbacher man and his arrogant determination [458]that taxes and sacrifices were for the little people only, while he and his friends lived in splendid luxury as their fellow citizens endured job losses, high taxes and emigration. What measures does the budget have to share the burdens of today? I see very few. There is no doubt the coping classes, people on PAYE earning between €40,000 and €80,000, will pay for the bulk of the measures in the budget. They will bear the brunt of the cutbacks and levies. When they go to an accident and emergency unit that cost will rise from €66 to €100. They will pay and pay. Why then are we not sharing any burdens in the budget? We tolerate the tax exiles who still dominate many sectors of the economy while refusing to contribute their share. We still riddle the tax codes with exemptions and breaks for the super rich, including the very people whose banking practices have brought us to the sorry state we are in today.

Most citizens have braced themselves for sacrifices. I am not at all sure that feeling is shared by our local “Masters of the Universe”, who blithely demand cuts in public services to facilitate their unlimited greed and avarice. I wonder if that banker who expressed his desire to see cutbacks just after he had been bailed out will give the budget top marks. He will not suffer but many of the people he recommended should suffer, will. I wish I was more confident the Minister had some of those people in his sights today. All the talk of burden sharing is shallow unless people see clear evidence of it, but there is precious little such evidence in today’s budget.

The present crisis bears the fingerprints of the extreme free-market advocates who have dominated economic thought for two decades. What is missing from the budget is a recognition that those two decades of freebooting, unregulated markets are over and that we are turning a page into a new period. The free marketeers always had a naive belief that free markets are always self-correcting and that markets left to themselves will always achieve the best results. They are the ideologues who believe any regulation of private business is fundamentally wrong. They are the ones who have resisted the regulation of financial markets and the supervision of financial institutions. They believe that government is always the problem, never the solution. Some members of Government have done much to undermine the ethos of the public service. They are so hostile to any notion of public service that they appear to forget the vast bulk of teachers, doctors and nurses are public servants. The motto of those ideologues is “Public service bad, private sector good”.

When there is a crash the self-same ideologues argue we should cover their losses with the people’s taxes. The same people always demand lower and lower taxes for themselves and many pay none at all. There is an alternative viewpoint and it is high time it was heard. It is one that recognises the importance of markets, but also recognises the limitations of markets. It recognises the role of the public good and market regulation. It values transparency, honesty, competition and innovation but does not encourage speculation or reward for merely short-term success. It is a political culture that values profit and productivity achieved through hard work, but does not endorse the ethic of the quick buck or the scheme nobody else knew about because it was in the small print of the tax code as a way of avoiding taxes.

I believe in incentives and rewards. I also believe trust and traditional ethical standards are essential elements of the financial and business system. I believe in the profit motive but I also believe in responsibility to the community where those profits are made. After a decade of so much squandered on the short term, we must encourage a much wider debate in the community on the role values play in economics and business. We need to have a debate on how we assess the long-term values of companies, their executives and their assets against their long-term performance, as opposed to the short-term asset bubbles we have experienced at such a high cost that are now wreaking so much devastation in the economy. This is very much a values [459]debate; greed and mega profits as against a culture that values hard work and thinking about and preparing for tomorrow.

In many ways today is the epitaph of the Celtic tiger. I regret the lack of a universal child care system and the lack of provision for pre-school education. What can one say about the Greens? It is a bit like Norman Tebbit and “On your bike”. We welcome the provision of €1,000 to buy a bike once every five years.

Wow, every five years one can write off €1,000 if one buys a bike.

The sentiment is well meant but the meat in the Green sandwich ought to have been public transport, especially the interconnector and the metro to the airport.

They are effectively side-lined or long-lined, whatever one wants to call it, in this budget. They are side-lined and put out to grass.

We were promised that a carbon levy was under consideration by the Commission on Taxation. Carbon taxes are about changing behaviour as much as about raising income. It has been promised over and over again that carbon levies would be revenue neutral. Instead, what is there today? There is an increase in petrol of 8 cent from tonight. There is a planning system that has tens of thousands of people living many miles from all of our major cities and towns.

The people living in these places have no public transport. They have no park-and-ride facilities, other than on the south side of Dublin, at locations where they can leave the car and easily get to work on a train. If one wants to save the planet one must first provide a mechanism for people to change behaviour. One does this by investing in public transport. If nothing else, this budget reinstates the primacy of roads. The indications are that we will pay from €700 million up to €900 million over the next five years because of Kyoto Protocol commitments. I would have welcomed more initiatives in the budget to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and make our contribution to reduce global warming.

This budget is about Fianna Fáil hubris. Like Icarus, that party flew too close to the sun, claimed they could do everything and now, unfortunately, we are the people on top of which they have crash landed.

I am sure he and the Taoiseach would want to be remembered not just for economic success, however elusive that seems in present circumstances, but also for a progressive record in advancing social justice, so let him answer the following simple question. After 12 years in power, why is income inequality still so deep and why is wealth inequality in assets worse than when the Government took office?

The Government has invented more tax breaks in a decade for the rich than their accountants can keep up with. It is a Government which has presided over a widening, not a narrowing, of inequalities of personal wealth. The top 1% now own more of the nation’s wealth than they ever did.

The people will support decisions made by the Government to salvage the principal elements of the banking system but the Government and taxpayers must get what people who provide capital are entitled to, namely, a share in ownership so that all the gains of a successful rescue plan do not go to the people who made the mess in the first place but back to the taxpayers who made significant sacrifices to calm the situation down and rescue it.

The banks have to be made fit for purpose. We need to take a back-to-basics approach to the banking sector. The reformed financial system, built by the Government and paid for by the taxpayer, needs to be plain and old fashioned. In the United States it is called “plain vanilla finance”. The banking system should be restored to its traditional role of supplying credit to the real economy, with as few complications or fancy products as possible. We need a system in which retail banks accept savings and make loans for regular businesses, large and small, and regular mortgages for families around the country, and where the complexity of financial products is strictly limited and subject to the kind of independent safety tests associated with new drugs or cars. That is serious hard-touch regulation and citizens will rightly insist on it as the price of any further rescue package.

Despite the huge rise in the budget deficit and the many spending cuts and tax increases outlined by the Minister, the budget’s impact will probably be overshadowed in the next ten years by further tax increases to pay for bank bailouts. The Minister has said the unnecessarily wide-ranging bank guarantee will not cost taxpayers anything. He is wrong and taxpayers will pay the price for his, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen’s, misjudgments.

The budget brings back many unhappy memories of an era we hoped would never return. One nasty feature of that era, which we only discovered years later through the tribunals, was the hidden offshore accounts. We remember Ansbacher man and his arrogant determination [458]that taxes and sacrifices were for the little people only, while he and his friends lived in splendid luxury as their fellow citizens endured job losses, high taxes and emigration. What measures does the budget have to share the burdens of today? I see very few. There is no doubt the coping classes, people on PAYE earning between €40,000 and €80,000, will pay for the bulk of the measures in the budget. They will bear the brunt of the cutbacks and levies. When they go to an accident and emergency unit that cost will rise from €66 to €100. They will pay and pay. Why then are we not sharing any burdens in the budget? We tolerate the tax exiles who still dominate many sectors of the economy while refusing to contribute their share. We still riddle the tax codes with exemptions and breaks for the super rich, including the very people whose banking practices have brought us to the sorry state we are in today.

Most citizens have braced themselves for sacrifices. I am not at all sure that feeling is shared by our local “Masters of the Universe”, who blithely demand cuts in public services to facilitate their unlimited greed and avarice. I wonder if that banker who expressed his desire to see cutbacks just after he had been bailed out will give the budget top marks. He will not suffer but many of the people he recommended should suffer, will. I wish I was more confident the Minister had some of those people in his sights today. All the talk of burden sharing is shallow unless people see clear evidence of it, but there is precious little such evidence in today’s budget.

The present crisis bears the fingerprints of the extreme free-market advocates who have dominated economic thought for two decades. What is missing from the budget is a recognition that those two decades of freebooting, unregulated markets are over and that we are turning a page into a new period. The free marketeers always had a naive belief that free markets are always self-correcting and that markets left to themselves will always achieve the best results. They are the ideologues who believe any regulation of private business is fundamentally wrong. They are the ones who have resisted the regulation of financial markets and the supervision of financial institutions. They believe that government is always the problem, never the solution. Some members of Government have done much to undermine the ethos of the public service. They are so hostile to any notion of public service that they appear to forget the vast bulk of teachers, doctors and nurses are public servants. The motto of those ideologues is “Public service bad, private sector good”.

When there is a crash the self-same ideologues argue we should cover their losses with the people’s taxes. The same people always demand lower and lower taxes for themselves and many pay none at all. There is an alternative viewpoint and it is high time it was heard. It is one that recognises the importance of markets, but also recognises the limitations of markets. It recognises the role of the public good and market regulation. It values transparency, honesty, competition and innovation but does not encourage speculation or reward for merely short-term success. It is a political culture that values profit and productivity achieved through hard work, but does not endorse the ethic of the quick buck or the scheme nobody else knew about because it was in the small print of the tax code as a way of avoiding taxes.

I believe in incentives and rewards. I also believe trust and traditional ethical standards are essential elements of the financial and business system. I believe in the profit motive but I also believe in responsibility to the community where those profits are made. After a decade of so much squandered on the short term, we must encourage a much wider debate in the community on the role values play in economics and business. We need to have a debate on how we assess the long-term values of companies, their executives and their assets against their long-term performance, as opposed to the short-term asset bubbles we have experienced at such a high cost that are now wreaking so much devastation in the economy. This is very much a values [459]debate; greed and mega profits as against a culture that values hard work and thinking about and preparing for tomorrow.

In many ways today is the epitaph of the Celtic tiger. I regret the lack of a universal child care system and the lack of provision for pre-school education. What can one say about the Greens? It is a bit like Norman Tebbit and “On your bike”. We welcome the provision of €1,000 to buy a bike once every five years.

Wow, every five years one can write off €1,000 if one buys a bike.

The sentiment is well meant but the meat in the Green sandwich ought to have been public transport, especially the interconnector and the metro to the airport.

They are effectively side-lined or long-lined, whatever one wants to call it, in this budget. They are side-lined and put out to grass.

We were promised that a carbon levy was under consideration by the Commission on Taxation. Carbon taxes are about changing behaviour as much as about raising income. It has been promised over and over again that carbon levies would be revenue neutral. Instead, what is there today? There is an increase in petrol of 8 cent from tonight. There is a planning system that has tens of thousands of people living many miles from all of our major cities and towns.

The people living in these places have no public transport. They have no park-and-ride facilities, other than on the south side of Dublin, at locations where they can leave the car and easily get to work on a train. If one wants to save the planet one must first provide a mechanism for people to change behaviour. One does this by investing in public transport. If nothing else, this budget reinstates the primacy of roads. The indications are that we will pay from €700 million up to €900 million over the next five years because of Kyoto Protocol commitments. I would have welcomed more initiatives in the budget to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and make our contribution to reduce global warming.

This budget is about Fianna Fáil hubris. Like Icarus, that party flew too close to the sun, claimed they could do everything and now, unfortunately, we are the people on top of which they have crash landed.
