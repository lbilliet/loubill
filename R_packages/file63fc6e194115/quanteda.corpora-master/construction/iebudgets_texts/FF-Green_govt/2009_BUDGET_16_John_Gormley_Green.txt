This has been an exceptionally challenging budget framed against difficult international economic circumstances. We are duty bound to take action to put the public finances on a sound footing in the interests of all the citizens of the country.

In doing this, the Government has not taken a short-term view——

——but has looked to ensuring economic and environmental sustainability, to promoting the competitiveness of the economy so that it will be able to respond quickly when the global situation improves, and above all to protecting the most vulnerable in our society.

All of these principles are clearly seen in the estimates for my own Department. We have forensically examined all expenditure. We have had to make difficult decisions, but I believe we made the right ones.

For example, we have concentrated housing expenditure on social housing and protecting the most vulnerable. We are investing in environmental protection concerning water, waste management and the natural and built heritage. In addition, we have increased investment in the water services investment programme by a massive 19% in the interests of protecting public health, compliance with EU environment standards and supporting economic development. I will return to these issues in greater detail later.

Today, I am presenting the second annual carbon budget. When I introduced the concept last year, I explained the thinking that led to its inclusion in the Agreed Programme for Government. If climate change is to be central to Government policy-making, it must be integrated into the annual budgetary process. Our decisions on expenditure and taxation must be informed as much by the climate impact as by the financial and economic impacts.

Given the unprecedented financial backdrop to this year’s budget, many might have expected climate considerations to receive little, if any, attention. That would have been a huge mistake. As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Leader of the Green Party, I have spoken in the House on many occasions about the environmental cost of our greenhouse gas emissions. In the context of today’s debate, however, the focus must also be on their financial and economic cost. If we do not reduce our emissions, the long-term costs to the Exchequer and to the economy will be immense.

While the international negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement have not yet concluded, we already know that Ireland will be required to reduce its emissions by 2020 to a level at least 20% below that of 2005, and probably by considerably more. As we stretch the time horizon towards 2050, the scientific consensus is that the cuts required of developed countries could be as much as 80% to 95%, if the worst effects of global warming are to be avoided.

These cuts will not be optional. They will be binding on Ireland under future EU and UN agreements and we will face hefty financial sanctions if we fail to meet them. We must, therefore, prepare the ground now for a major structural change in our economy and our society, so we can continue to develop and prosper while simultaneously reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. The Government has accepted this reality and has agreed a budget that is designed not just to restore financial stability, but also to move us further towards the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy.

I have circulated a short table which sets out the trend in Ireland’s emissions, including the projections for the Kyoto period. The table includes provisional estimates of 2007 emissions, which have just been completed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency has done excellent work in completing its calculations two months earlier than planned. There was speculation in some media a few weeks ago that our emissions would be substantially up on the previous year, but that is not the case. The table shows a welcome fall of just over 1% in net emissions, taking account of increased sequestration though afforestation. Net emissions have fallen from 68.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2006 to 67.9 million tonnes in 2007. While the reduction in 2007 is welcome, it offers cold comfort in the context of the baseline trend for the Kyoto period. Over the past year, the Government has committed significant resources to improving the capacity to model and project emissions across the various sectors. This has enabled the EPA, with the support of relevant agencies in the various sectors, comprehensively to update projections for the Kyoto period, which were included in the national climate change strategy.

This analysis shows that, even after allowing for the implementation of the measures that have already been put in place by the Government, the baseline trend continues to rise. The most striking revision relates to transport emissions. The average level for the Kyoto period is, in advance of new measures, put at close to 2 million tonnes a year more than was projected [791]last year. The downward trend in agriculture has also been reversed, as livestock numbers have begun to rise again.

There is a sizable fall in projected emissions in the residential sector, thanks in part to the energy efficiency measures that have been introduced in the past year, but this is overwhelmed by the baseline changes in transport and agriculture. The consequence, as shown in column D of the table, is that the Government is, in advance of new measures, projected to have a gap of 5 million tonnes a year. This must be bridged by a combination of further measures and purchasing credits under the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto protocol.

The House is aware that, on coming into office last year, the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security, chaired by the Taoiseach. One of its main tasks has been to drive the cross-departmental effort to develop further measures to reduce emissions. The wider public sector is also contributing to this effort. Tomorrow, I will be speaking at a major conference on the way forward for local authorities in addressing climate change.

As a result of the work of the Cabinet sub-committee, this year’s Estimates and budget process have given greater priority than ever before on the need for emission reductions, notwithstanding the emphasis that has inevitably been placed on financial stability in the particular circumstances of the time.

I now propose to draw together the key responses across various sectors. Some will deliver emission reductions in the short to medium term, and these are reflected in columns E and F of the table. However, the longer term is even more important. Real structural change cannot be achieved overnight, but we need to put the drivers in place if we are to get the benefit in future. Much of what I am outlining today will take time to deliver, including emission reductions, but in the long run they will have a significant effect.

One of the most effective ways of reducing our national greenhouse gas emissions is to generate as much electricity as possible from renewable sources rather than from fossil fuels. The previous Government adopted a target that 33% of electricity consumed would be from renewable sources by 2020. Today I can confirm that the Government has agreed, on the recommendation of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to increase this target to 40%.

The target is underpinned by analysis conducted in the recent all-island grid study which found that a 40% penetration is technically feasible, subject to upgrading our electricity grid and ensuring the development of flexible generating plant on the electricity system. The study concludes that this higher level of renewable electricity would reduce our carbon emissions from electricity by 25% over the business-as-usual scenario, a saving of around 5 million tonnes.

This work was further underpinned by the new electricity grid development strategy which was published by EirGrid last week. The Government will be conducting further analysis to ensure that the higher renewable electricity target supports competitiveness, is delivered on time and at least cost to consumers and businesses, while maximising sustainable socio-economic benefits.

The decision provides a clear and strong message from Government on its commitment to ensure secure, competitive and sustainable energy sources.

I was also pleased to launch last week the stakeholder consultation paper that sets out the detailed implementation plan for the new energy efficiency standard for light bulbs and I want to record my appreciation of the support received from the lighting industry in finalising the measure.

Emission reductions in most sectors take time to achieve and transport is a case in point. In the past, an over-emphasis was placed on road transport by Governments and the public, and the result is evident in our spiralling transport emissions. However, the Government is shifting the emphasis towards public transport and is supporting and incentivising the behavioural change that will deliver a more sustainable transport future for all of us.

The new emphasis has been seen clearly in this year’s budget. Despite the very difficult financial backdrop, key public transport projects are being continued to ensure continued enhancement of rail services, particularly to support commuters, and increased priority is being given to buses in Dublin and other cities. The critical strategic priorities in Transport 21, such as metro north and the DART interconnector, will go ahead.

The commuting experience will be significantly improved through: the removal of pinch points on quality bus corridors and other bus routes, integrated ticketing using smart card technology and real-time passenger information at bus stops and on mobile phones. Most people who stand at a bus stop experience the frustration of not knowing when the bus will come. Having this information available by mobile phone will make a difference to the attractiveness of public transport.

However, capital investment on its own is not enough. The Government must also encourage significant behavioural change by providing a clear vision of a more sustainable transport future backed up by strong policies. That vision and those policies will be set out in the sustainable travel and transport action plan, which will be published shortly by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, who earlier this morning made announcements about this.

In association with that plan, the Minister will also be developing national cycling and walking strategies to encourage emission-free modes of travel. The plan will set out to create a culture of walking and cycling, in particular, by ensuring that streets in urban areas are managed and designed so that we have safe and pleasant environments for pedestrians and cyclists. Today I can confirm that the Minister and I will be providing a special cycling package for Dublin to the tune of €5 million to include funding for work on the city centre portion of the proposed Sutton to Sandycove cycle route. The Minister for Transport and I will also be providing funding to upgrade and maintain existing cycle routes in Dublin.

In addition, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, together with the Minister for Transport, will announce in the coming [793]weeks the development of a strategy to have up to 10% of our road transport fleet electrically powered by 2020. The aim is that Ireland should be among the early movers in exploiting recent international advances in electric vehicle technologies, moving from advanced plug-in hybrid vehicles to full electric vehicles which have no direct CO2 emissions.

A particular advantage of this technology is that the vehicles are typically recharged at night, when the electricity system has its lowest load demand. As we move towards increasing our renewable electricity generation, mainly by developing new wind capacity, electric vehicles would provide a useful market for night-time wind generation.

The first full year in which the major taxes on cars are based solely on their emissions will be 2009. This follows the introduction in last year’s budget of CO2 based motor tax and VRT. The early indications from the first three months of the new system are of a strong trend towards lower-emission vehicles. Of the 42,000 cars which are now charged motor tax on the basis of emissions, 85% are in the three lowest bands. The increases in motor tax, which I introduced last night, maintain the strong incentive in the system to switch to lower emission cars when purchasing new vehicles, with a higher rate of increase for cars above the 2.5 litre threshold and CO2 bands E, F and G, and no increase for electric vehicles. I intend to keep the motor tax system under review, in consultation with the motor industry, to ensure that it meets the twin objectives of protecting local government funding while incentivising greener motoring in future years.

The Government’s vision for the transport sector involves major structural change. This will take time to deliver and to make a significant impact on emissions. In the shorter time period of our Kyoto target, my Department has estimated that the impact of the relevant fiscal and other measures in this budget on transport emissions will average 200,000 tonnes per annum over the 2008-12 period, and this is reflected in the carbon budget table.

In terms of the role that we can expect from the residential sector in meeting our emissions reduction targets, I am determined that the public sector leads the way. I am, therefore, announcing a number of initiatives today that provide a platform for significant progress in this area.

Public housing in Ireland has a long record of achieving high quality by reference to the standards prevailing at the time of construction, but energy efficiency standards are now far higher than when much of our public housing stock was built. Remedial works and regeneration programmes, undertaken by local authorities and funded by my Department, are delivering significant energy efficiency improvements in various locations——

——but a more comprehensive programme of action is now required.

A full audit of the public housing stock will begin in 2009 to lay the foundation for a programme of retrofitting, where required——

——to deliver modern standards of energy efficiency. In addition, in parallel with this audit, €5 million will be provided next year to undertake a number of pilot retrofitting projects; the learning derived from these will play a major part in informing our approach to the wider roll-out of the programme, which will commence once the audit is completed. Not only will the ultimate national roll-out of the programme contribute in a significant way to the achievement of reductions in carbon emissions, it will also yield a vital fuel poverty dividend.

[794]In addition to this essential need to deal with the legacy of the past, I am also determined that we look to the future and explore ways in which we can make greater progress on designing out the carbon impacts of new housing. Much has been achieved already with dwellings now required to deliver 40% greater energy efficiency on the standards applicable in 2005 and we intend to bring the improvement on the 2005 position to 60% in 2010. However, we now need to plan beyond that. We need to push the boundaries of environmental performance of housing further towards the goal of achieving zero carbon emissions.

To show further clear leadership on the part of the public sector, I have invited local authorities and voluntary/co-operative housing associations to submit proposals for the delivery of a number of demonstration projects in this area. The aim of these will be to deliver sustainable energy efficient housing developments in which homes will reach a minimum A2 building energy rating. Some €10 million will be provided next year, and again in 2010, to support these demonstration projects, which will significantly advance the knowledge and experience base in the design, construction and use of high performing energy efficient housing and promote wider awareness of the technologies involved.

I also very much welcome the additional funding provided in the budget for two schemes which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The home energy saving scheme, introduced this year, provides grants to householders to improve the energy performance of their homes, while the warmer homes scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to lower-income households in the private sector.

The measures I have outlined in the residential sector, which amount to an investment of €45 million in the coming year, will support the achievement of the emission reduction targets which have already been set out in the Government’s draft energy efficiency action plan and are, therefore, already quantified in the carbon budget table.

Similarly, I am not separately quantifying the impact of the expansion of accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment, which was announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday, but this will reinforce the drive towards greater efficiency and reduced emissions in the commercial and industrial sector.

The importance of livestock-based agriculture and food production to Ireland’s economy is unique within the EU. The scale of the sector is such that it will be impossible to meet our [795]long-term greenhouse gas targets without significant emission reductions in agriculture. We must find ways of achieving this without undermining the economy, food security and rural communities. The Government is investing heavily in wide-ranging research on the potential for more efficient use of inputs, improved production systems and other emission-abatement measures. The considerable effort we are now devoting to the promotion of organic farming will also result in lower emissions. Similarly, promotion of biomass for energy will give multiple climate benefits.

As in other sectors, most of the benefit will come in the longer term and will be more relevant to our 2020 target than to the Kyoto period. However, the Department of Agriculture and Food has estimated emission reductions of 200,000 tonnes per annum on average in the 2008-12 period through new measures now being introduced, and this is reflected in the table I have circulated to Members. These accrue mainly from organic farming and from increasing the length of the grazing season.

The final two columns of the table show the adjustment to the projections for the Kyoto period as a result of the measures I have outlined. It is important to note that the economic growth rates underlying the EPA projections are broadly similar to the ESRI’s “Benchmark” forecast which was published in its Medium-Term Review: 2008-2015 last May. It may well be the case that the projections now somewhat overstate the baseline trend for the Kyoto period, given economic developments since May. They will be revised when new forecasts for medium-term economic growth are firmed up, and I expect some further reduction in the distance to target. This also means that the requirement to purchase credits is likely to be somewhat less than the 4.6 million tonnes shown in column F of the table.

I have made my position on carbon credits very clear on several occasions. I recognise that the flexible mechanisms are an integral part of the Kyoto Protocol and I appreciate the value of promoting green investment, particularly in developing countries. I do not have a difficulty availing of the flexible mechanisms to help meet our obligations in the short term, but with one major qualification. We must not under any circumstances allow the availability of carbon credits to deflect us from taking the necessary actions to place us on a low carbon trajectory in the longer term. Over-reliance on carbon credits in the future will be a millstone which will hold back our economic development and deny us the advantages which will flow from early-mover adoption of efficient technology in transport, energy production, agriculture and in our homes and workplaces.

This year’s carbon budget is a starting point but much more progress will be required in the coming year. I particularly welcome confirmation by the Minister for Finance that an announcement on the carbon levy will be included in next year’s budget, taking account of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation when it has reported. The principle of carbon pricing is accepted by virtually all economists and analysts as the most effective way to secure emission reductions. It is the basis of the EU’s emission trading scheme which applies to the bigger emitters, such as power generators and industrial plants. The carbon levy will enable us to harness its benefits in the rest of the economy and will deliver a further reduction which will be reflected in next year’s carbon budget table. Over the next year the Government will develop further measures to get to grips with the climate challenge, reduce our purchases of carbon credits and bring us on track for the annual average 3% reduction in emissions to which we are committed in the programme for Government.

We must also ensure that Ireland’s economy adjusts to a low-carbon future. It is estimated that the green technology sector is now worth €284 billion worldwide. The European Commission estimates that eco-industry in Europe already employs more people than either car manufacturing or chemicals, and various reports have projected huge employment growth in the years ahead. Instead of merely taking technological developments from other countries, we have an opportunity to play a leading role in developing a green economy. Some years ago we harnessed the State’s industrial, educational, enterprise and development resources to develop biopharmaceutical and ICT sectors in Ireland, leading to significant inward investment and highly productive employment. The Government intends to take a similar approach to the development of the green technology sector. We have already made significant steps towards embracing this growth area but, to be effective, we must take a “whole-of-Government” approach.

In this regard, the Government’s Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security is examining how the green economy might best be fostered. In the coming weeks a number of Ministers who have responsibility in the relevant areas will collectively announce the establishment of a high level action group to advise on the development of Ireland’s green economy. The group will report to Government within four months, setting out an action plan for developing green enterprise in Ireland with a view to contributing to economic growth and providing new, quality employment opportunities in this growing sector. The group will be tasked with identifying the potential for enterprise development, how education and training might address skills deficits, necessary research and development and the potential for Irish firms to bid for public procurement opportunities throughout the EU. We are determined to guide our economic development and well-being on to a sustainable and low carbon path. By successfully developing a thriving green technology sector, we can look forward to making a significant contribution to emission reductions.

The State already plays a direct role in the economic life of the country. It directly purchases products and engages services through public procurement. The Government is currently considering how our public service can give greater consideration to environmental impacts in its procurement arrangements. This has the potential to play a significant role in giving an incentive to companies to improve their environmental performance, leading to reductions in emissions, and in assisting Irish companies in successful international public procurement competitions.

I do not under estimate the scale of the environmental challenges we face, nor am I under any illusion about the uphill struggle we have in tackling our climate change emissions. The modest steps we are taking, which are undoubtedly an improvement on what has gone before, will not be enough to achieve the type of emission reductions we require. We must be much more radical. The introduction of a carbon levy next year will be an important step, but it is only one step in what has to be a fundamental multi-faceted approach, involving all Departments.

I have been campaigning on environmental issues for all of my adult life and I know what must be done. We have very little time to do it. It is worth making the effort even if it is at times frustrating. I retain the hope that we can work together on these very important issues on a non-partisan basis.

If the Deputies have any ideas on this subject, I will listen to them any time.

I will now comment on some specific aspects of my Department’s Estimates. I will concentrate on the principal sectors within my Department’s broad remit. In 2009, my Department will continue to advance the protection of our environment and ensure compliance with EU standards with regard to water, waste and species protection. My policies and programmes will be framed against the background of the state of the environment report, Ireland’s Environment, published last week. This is the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment of our environment available.

The provision of €560 million for 2009 is the highest ever for water services infrastructure, representing an increase of 19% over 2008. Against the present economic backdrop this is the clearest possible statement by the Government of the priority we are giving to preserving and protecting our water resources as a key element of our environment——

——to meeting EU standards for drinking water and waste water treatment and to providing critical infrastructure that will ensure ongoing support for the economy. Good quality water and waste water services are vital for housing, industrial and commercial development. A recent Forfás report helps to identify key locations where improved water services will be needed to capitalise on potential investment in new jobs and services in the future. The record 2009 allocation means that the resources will be available to meet these challenges and to deal with the water services requirements of smaller towns and villages up and down the country.

This Exchequer support for water services is backed up by the greatly improved supervisory structures I have put in place to ensure an optimum return from the investment, both in terms of service to the consumer and environmental protection. I have provided the Environmental Protection Agency with the resources to ensure it can effectively carry out the new supervisory functions given to it under the drinking water regulations.

The agency and local authority response to recent lead excesses in certain water supplies is evidence of the effectiveness of this new regime. It also reminds us of the fundamental necessity to ensure that the quality of our drinking water supplies meets the highest standards. In that context, I recently announced a wide range of additional measures to secure universal compliance with drinking water standards, including accelerated progress with key schemes and immediate remedial measures to respond to potential risks identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Drinking water quality data will also soon be available on local authority websites for everyone to see, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. On the waste water side, discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants are now subject to licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency to guarantee conformity with effluent standards and to protect the quality of the receiving waters.

The Environmental Protection Agency is central to our efforts to protect and enhance our environment. The 2008 Exchequer provision for the agency of almost €35 million, together with its income from licensing and the environment fund, positions it well to continue to carry out its very important environmental functions on our behalf.

This year has seen major advances in the development of our built heritage programme. In addition to providing ongoing support for the civic structures and architectural conservation grants schemes, I have also been in a position to progress new funding programmes such as the places of public worship fund and the INSTAR archaeological research fund. The provision of more than €25 million for built heritage in 2009 will consolidate the progress made during 2008. Next year’s allocation for the Heritage Council of more than €11 million will allow the council to progress key initiatives such as the buildings-at-risk programme.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is responsible for the provision of front-line services for the protection of nature. It enforces habitat and species protection, in addition to providing expertise and advice to Departments——

——landowners, farmers, local authorities and other stakeholders in regard to protecting sensitive sites and species.

In 2008, I gave priority to work that will enable us to meet our obligations under the EU birds and habitats directives, through measures such as the reallocation of resources to high-priority areas and through putting in place pressing conservation initiatives. This will remain my focus in 2009. Substantial funding will continue to be made available for the protection of Ireland’s wildlife and habitats, necessary research, surveying and monitoring, the bog compensation scheme and agri-environmental measures to protect specific habitats and species.

However difficult the economic transition we are experiencing may be, there are certain priorities that must always remain at the top of the political agenda. That is why, in the overall financial provision for housing in 2009, our focus is on utilising the very significant resources that will be available in a way that takes account of the needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society.

The total Exchequer provision for housing will be almost €1.66 billion in current and capital finance. By any measure, this is a very significant sum. It will allow for the progress made in 2008, when the needs of almost 18,300 households were met through the broad range of social and affordable housing programmes, to be further built on.

The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Finneran, will soon announce details of an expansion of the existing local authority mortgage scheme. It will be a targeted and time-limited initiative to reflect the fact that access to mortgage finance has perhaps become an even greater obstacle to house purchase for first-time buyers than affordability.

The scheme has been carefully framed to offer a line of credit to households who have made the decision to enter the market at this time but who are unable to do so because of the credit crunch.

The scheme will facilitate, and not incentivise, the home-ownership aspirations of these households to avoid any distortional impact on the correction that is under way in the housing market.

Significant financial challenges face local government over the coming years resulting from the downturn in the economic cycle.

There are significant financial challenges——

——facing local government over the coming years resulting from the downturn in the economic cycle. In working together at central and local levels to deal responsibly with the current economic challenges, the same principles I outlined in regard to the Government’s budgetary strategy apply. Local authorities will work to ensure that they are in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the economy as it recovers during the period ahead.

Local government has benefited greatly from the additional resources devoted to it in recent years and it is now on a considerably sounder financial footing. Local authorities will spend well some €11.5 billion in 2008 in both capital and current expenditure. Even with the necessary adjustments arising from this budget, local authorities will still be very significant economic players locally and nationally.

I will announce my local government fund allocations to local authorities shortly to allow elected members and officials the time necessary to frame productive and prudent budgets for 2009.

This Government has had to make very difficult choices——

——in framing the national budget. Local authority members will face some of the same challenges as they seek to cope with the less favourable economic and financial position in their annual budget processes. It is important that local authority members of all parties show leadership at local level and do not shy away from the difficult choices required.

The fiscal position of the Exchequer is extremely difficult. We have had to examine carefully all spending lines and all potential revenue sources. Expanding the revenue base of local authorities is a progressive step.

The announcement in yesterday’s budget that a new charge is to be introduced for non-principal private residences represents a significant step in the expansion of that base. What we have done is simple and equitable. It will share the burden more broadly and serve us well for the future.

A charge of €200 per annum is being introduced for all non-principal private residences. It will be levied and collected by local authorities and, on a conservative estimate, will yield €40 million per annum. The revenue stream will be used to contribute to the Exchequer funding to local authorities for operational costs. Liability for payment of the charge will lie with property owners and not with the occupiers.

I intend to ask the Government to approve legislation to give effect to this measure in the near future so the charge can be applied from 2009 and the House will have an opportunity at that date to discuss its details.

On the wider issue of local government reform, I have just concluded a process of public consultation on the reform options set out in the Green Paper. I am very pleased with the wide range of responses received. I am now considering those responses and am working, as a key priority, to finalise policy decisions in the Government’s White Paper.

The measures I have outlined show the Government has responded well in these difficult times by taking immediate action to protect the public finances while at the same time ensuring environmental and economic sustainability and protecting the most vulnerable in society.

=======
This has been an exceptionally challenging budget framed against difficult international economic circumstances. We are duty bound to take action to put the public finances on a sound footing in the interests of all the citizens of the country.

In doing this, the Government has not taken a short-term view——

——but has looked to ensuring economic and environmental sustainability, to promoting the competitiveness of the economy so that it will be able to respond quickly when the global situation improves, and above all to protecting the most vulnerable in our society.

All of these principles are clearly seen in the estimates for my own Department. We have forensically examined all expenditure. We have had to make difficult decisions, but I believe we made the right ones.

For example, we have concentrated housing expenditure on social housing and protecting the most vulnerable. We are investing in environmental protection concerning water, waste management and the natural and built heritage. In addition, we have increased investment in the water services investment programme by a massive 19% in the interests of protecting public health, compliance with EU environment standards and supporting economic development. I will return to these issues in greater detail later.

Today, I am presenting the second annual carbon budget. When I introduced the concept last year, I explained the thinking that led to its inclusion in the Agreed Programme for Government. If climate change is to be central to Government policy-making, it must be integrated into the annual budgetary process. Our decisions on expenditure and taxation must be informed as much by the climate impact as by the financial and economic impacts.

Given the unprecedented financial backdrop to this year’s budget, many might have expected climate considerations to receive little, if any, attention. That would have been a huge mistake. As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Leader of the Green Party, I have spoken in the House on many occasions about the environmental cost of our greenhouse gas emissions. In the context of today’s debate, however, the focus must also be on their financial and economic cost. If we do not reduce our emissions, the long-term costs to the Exchequer and to the economy will be immense.

While the international negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement have not yet concluded, we already know that Ireland will be required to reduce its emissions by 2020 to a level at least 20% below that of 2005, and probably by considerably more. As we stretch the time horizon towards 2050, the scientific consensus is that the cuts required of developed countries could be as much as 80% to 95%, if the worst effects of global warming are to be avoided.

These cuts will not be optional. They will be binding on Ireland under future EU and UN agreements and we will face hefty financial sanctions if we fail to meet them. We must, therefore, prepare the ground now for a major structural change in our economy and our society, so we can continue to develop and prosper while simultaneously reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. The Government has accepted this reality and has agreed a budget that is designed not just to restore financial stability, but also to move us further towards the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy.

I have circulated a short table which sets out the trend in Ireland’s emissions, including the projections for the Kyoto period. The table includes provisional estimates of 2007 emissions, which have just been completed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency has done excellent work in completing its calculations two months earlier than planned. There was speculation in some media a few weeks ago that our emissions would be substantially up on the previous year, but that is not the case. The table shows a welcome fall of just over 1% in net emissions, taking account of increased sequestration though afforestation. Net emissions have fallen from 68.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2006 to 67.9 million tonnes in 2007. While the reduction in 2007 is welcome, it offers cold comfort in the context of the baseline trend for the Kyoto period. Over the past year, the Government has committed significant resources to improving the capacity to model and project emissions across the various sectors. This has enabled the EPA, with the support of relevant agencies in the various sectors, comprehensively to update projections for the Kyoto period, which were included in the national climate change strategy.

This analysis shows that, even after allowing for the implementation of the measures that have already been put in place by the Government, the baseline trend continues to rise. The most striking revision relates to transport emissions. The average level for the Kyoto period is, in advance of new measures, put at close to 2 million tonnes a year more than was projected [791]last year. The downward trend in agriculture has also been reversed, as livestock numbers have begun to rise again.

There is a sizable fall in projected emissions in the residential sector, thanks in part to the energy efficiency measures that have been introduced in the past year, but this is overwhelmed by the baseline changes in transport and agriculture. The consequence, as shown in column D of the table, is that the Government is, in advance of new measures, projected to have a gap of 5 million tonnes a year. This must be bridged by a combination of further measures and purchasing credits under the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto protocol.

The House is aware that, on coming into office last year, the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security, chaired by the Taoiseach. One of its main tasks has been to drive the cross-departmental effort to develop further measures to reduce emissions. The wider public sector is also contributing to this effort. Tomorrow, I will be speaking at a major conference on the way forward for local authorities in addressing climate change.

As a result of the work of the Cabinet sub-committee, this year’s Estimates and budget process have given greater priority than ever before on the need for emission reductions, notwithstanding the emphasis that has inevitably been placed on financial stability in the particular circumstances of the time.

I now propose to draw together the key responses across various sectors. Some will deliver emission reductions in the short to medium term, and these are reflected in columns E and F of the table. However, the longer term is even more important. Real structural change cannot be achieved overnight, but we need to put the drivers in place if we are to get the benefit in future. Much of what I am outlining today will take time to deliver, including emission reductions, but in the long run they will have a significant effect.

One of the most effective ways of reducing our national greenhouse gas emissions is to generate as much electricity as possible from renewable sources rather than from fossil fuels. The previous Government adopted a target that 33% of electricity consumed would be from renewable sources by 2020. Today I can confirm that the Government has agreed, on the recommendation of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to increase this target to 40%.

The target is underpinned by analysis conducted in the recent all-island grid study which found that a 40% penetration is technically feasible, subject to upgrading our electricity grid and ensuring the development of flexible generating plant on the electricity system. The study concludes that this higher level of renewable electricity would reduce our carbon emissions from electricity by 25% over the business-as-usual scenario, a saving of around 5 million tonnes.

This work was further underpinned by the new electricity grid development strategy which was published by EirGrid last week. The Government will be conducting further analysis to ensure that the higher renewable electricity target supports competitiveness, is delivered on time and at least cost to consumers and businesses, while maximising sustainable socio-economic benefits.

The decision provides a clear and strong message from Government on its commitment to ensure secure, competitive and sustainable energy sources.

I was also pleased to launch last week the stakeholder consultation paper that sets out the detailed implementation plan for the new energy efficiency standard for light bulbs and I want to record my appreciation of the support received from the lighting industry in finalising the measure.

Emission reductions in most sectors take time to achieve and transport is a case in point. In the past, an over-emphasis was placed on road transport by Governments and the public, and the result is evident in our spiralling transport emissions. However, the Government is shifting the emphasis towards public transport and is supporting and incentivising the behavioural change that will deliver a more sustainable transport future for all of us.

The new emphasis has been seen clearly in this year’s budget. Despite the very difficult financial backdrop, key public transport projects are being continued to ensure continued enhancement of rail services, particularly to support commuters, and increased priority is being given to buses in Dublin and other cities. The critical strategic priorities in Transport 21, such as metro north and the DART interconnector, will go ahead.

The commuting experience will be significantly improved through: the removal of pinch points on quality bus corridors and other bus routes, integrated ticketing using smart card technology and real-time passenger information at bus stops and on mobile phones. Most people who stand at a bus stop experience the frustration of not knowing when the bus will come. Having this information available by mobile phone will make a difference to the attractiveness of public transport.

However, capital investment on its own is not enough. The Government must also encourage significant behavioural change by providing a clear vision of a more sustainable transport future backed up by strong policies. That vision and those policies will be set out in the sustainable travel and transport action plan, which will be published shortly by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, who earlier this morning made announcements about this.

In association with that plan, the Minister will also be developing national cycling and walking strategies to encourage emission-free modes of travel. The plan will set out to create a culture of walking and cycling, in particular, by ensuring that streets in urban areas are managed and designed so that we have safe and pleasant environments for pedestrians and cyclists. Today I can confirm that the Minister and I will be providing a special cycling package for Dublin to the tune of €5 million to include funding for work on the city centre portion of the proposed Sutton to Sandycove cycle route. The Minister for Transport and I will also be providing funding to upgrade and maintain existing cycle routes in Dublin.

In addition, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, together with the Minister for Transport, will announce in the coming [793]weeks the development of a strategy to have up to 10% of our road transport fleet electrically powered by 2020. The aim is that Ireland should be among the early movers in exploiting recent international advances in electric vehicle technologies, moving from advanced plug-in hybrid vehicles to full electric vehicles which have no direct CO2 emissions.

A particular advantage of this technology is that the vehicles are typically recharged at night, when the electricity system has its lowest load demand. As we move towards increasing our renewable electricity generation, mainly by developing new wind capacity, electric vehicles would provide a useful market for night-time wind generation.

The first full year in which the major taxes on cars are based solely on their emissions will be 2009. This follows the introduction in last year’s budget of CO2 based motor tax and VRT. The early indications from the first three months of the new system are of a strong trend towards lower-emission vehicles. Of the 42,000 cars which are now charged motor tax on the basis of emissions, 85% are in the three lowest bands. The increases in motor tax, which I introduced last night, maintain the strong incentive in the system to switch to lower emission cars when purchasing new vehicles, with a higher rate of increase for cars above the 2.5 litre threshold and CO2 bands E, F and G, and no increase for electric vehicles. I intend to keep the motor tax system under review, in consultation with the motor industry, to ensure that it meets the twin objectives of protecting local government funding while incentivising greener motoring in future years.

The Government’s vision for the transport sector involves major structural change. This will take time to deliver and to make a significant impact on emissions. In the shorter time period of our Kyoto target, my Department has estimated that the impact of the relevant fiscal and other measures in this budget on transport emissions will average 200,000 tonnes per annum over the 2008-12 period, and this is reflected in the carbon budget table.

In terms of the role that we can expect from the residential sector in meeting our emissions reduction targets, I am determined that the public sector leads the way. I am, therefore, announcing a number of initiatives today that provide a platform for significant progress in this area.

Public housing in Ireland has a long record of achieving high quality by reference to the standards prevailing at the time of construction, but energy efficiency standards are now far higher than when much of our public housing stock was built. Remedial works and regeneration programmes, undertaken by local authorities and funded by my Department, are delivering significant energy efficiency improvements in various locations——

——but a more comprehensive programme of action is now required.

A full audit of the public housing stock will begin in 2009 to lay the foundation for a programme of retrofitting, where required——

——to deliver modern standards of energy efficiency. In addition, in parallel with this audit, €5 million will be provided next year to undertake a number of pilot retrofitting projects; the learning derived from these will play a major part in informing our approach to the wider roll-out of the programme, which will commence once the audit is completed. Not only will the ultimate national roll-out of the programme contribute in a significant way to the achievement of reductions in carbon emissions, it will also yield a vital fuel poverty dividend.

[794]In addition to this essential need to deal with the legacy of the past, I am also determined that we look to the future and explore ways in which we can make greater progress on designing out the carbon impacts of new housing. Much has been achieved already with dwellings now required to deliver 40% greater energy efficiency on the standards applicable in 2005 and we intend to bring the improvement on the 2005 position to 60% in 2010. However, we now need to plan beyond that. We need to push the boundaries of environmental performance of housing further towards the goal of achieving zero carbon emissions.

To show further clear leadership on the part of the public sector, I have invited local authorities and voluntary/co-operative housing associations to submit proposals for the delivery of a number of demonstration projects in this area. The aim of these will be to deliver sustainable energy efficient housing developments in which homes will reach a minimum A2 building energy rating. Some €10 million will be provided next year, and again in 2010, to support these demonstration projects, which will significantly advance the knowledge and experience base in the design, construction and use of high performing energy efficient housing and promote wider awareness of the technologies involved.

I also very much welcome the additional funding provided in the budget for two schemes which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The home energy saving scheme, introduced this year, provides grants to householders to improve the energy performance of their homes, while the warmer homes scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to lower-income households in the private sector.

The measures I have outlined in the residential sector, which amount to an investment of €45 million in the coming year, will support the achievement of the emission reduction targets which have already been set out in the Government’s draft energy efficiency action plan and are, therefore, already quantified in the carbon budget table.

Similarly, I am not separately quantifying the impact of the expansion of accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment, which was announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday, but this will reinforce the drive towards greater efficiency and reduced emissions in the commercial and industrial sector.

The importance of livestock-based agriculture and food production to Ireland’s economy is unique within the EU. The scale of the sector is such that it will be impossible to meet our [795]long-term greenhouse gas targets without significant emission reductions in agriculture. We must find ways of achieving this without undermining the economy, food security and rural communities. The Government is investing heavily in wide-ranging research on the potential for more efficient use of inputs, improved production systems and other emission-abatement measures. The considerable effort we are now devoting to the promotion of organic farming will also result in lower emissions. Similarly, promotion of biomass for energy will give multiple climate benefits.

As in other sectors, most of the benefit will come in the longer term and will be more relevant to our 2020 target than to the Kyoto period. However, the Department of Agriculture and Food has estimated emission reductions of 200,000 tonnes per annum on average in the 2008-12 period through new measures now being introduced, and this is reflected in the table I have circulated to Members. These accrue mainly from organic farming and from increasing the length of the grazing season.

The final two columns of the table show the adjustment to the projections for the Kyoto period as a result of the measures I have outlined. It is important to note that the economic growth rates underlying the EPA projections are broadly similar to the ESRI’s “Benchmark” forecast which was published in its Medium-Term Review: 2008-2015 last May. It may well be the case that the projections now somewhat overstate the baseline trend for the Kyoto period, given economic developments since May. They will be revised when new forecasts for medium-term economic growth are firmed up, and I expect some further reduction in the distance to target. This also means that the requirement to purchase credits is likely to be somewhat less than the 4.6 million tonnes shown in column F of the table.

I have made my position on carbon credits very clear on several occasions. I recognise that the flexible mechanisms are an integral part of the Kyoto Protocol and I appreciate the value of promoting green investment, particularly in developing countries. I do not have a difficulty availing of the flexible mechanisms to help meet our obligations in the short term, but with one major qualification. We must not under any circumstances allow the availability of carbon credits to deflect us from taking the necessary actions to place us on a low carbon trajectory in the longer term. Over-reliance on carbon credits in the future will be a millstone which will hold back our economic development and deny us the advantages which will flow from early-mover adoption of efficient technology in transport, energy production, agriculture and in our homes and workplaces.

This year’s carbon budget is a starting point but much more progress will be required in the coming year. I particularly welcome confirmation by the Minister for Finance that an announcement on the carbon levy will be included in next year’s budget, taking account of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation when it has reported. The principle of carbon pricing is accepted by virtually all economists and analysts as the most effective way to secure emission reductions. It is the basis of the EU’s emission trading scheme which applies to the bigger emitters, such as power generators and industrial plants. The carbon levy will enable us to harness its benefits in the rest of the economy and will deliver a further reduction which will be reflected in next year’s carbon budget table. Over the next year the Government will develop further measures to get to grips with the climate challenge, reduce our purchases of carbon credits and bring us on track for the annual average 3% reduction in emissions to which we are committed in the programme for Government.

We must also ensure that Ireland’s economy adjusts to a low-carbon future. It is estimated that the green technology sector is now worth €284 billion worldwide. The European Commission estimates that eco-industry in Europe already employs more people than either car manufacturing or chemicals, and various reports have projected huge employment growth in the years ahead. Instead of merely taking technological developments from other countries, we have an opportunity to play a leading role in developing a green economy. Some years ago we harnessed the State’s industrial, educational, enterprise and development resources to develop biopharmaceutical and ICT sectors in Ireland, leading to significant inward investment and highly productive employment. The Government intends to take a similar approach to the development of the green technology sector. We have already made significant steps towards embracing this growth area but, to be effective, we must take a “whole-of-Government” approach.

In this regard, the Government’s Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security is examining how the green economy might best be fostered. In the coming weeks a number of Ministers who have responsibility in the relevant areas will collectively announce the establishment of a high level action group to advise on the development of Ireland’s green economy. The group will report to Government within four months, setting out an action plan for developing green enterprise in Ireland with a view to contributing to economic growth and providing new, quality employment opportunities in this growing sector. The group will be tasked with identifying the potential for enterprise development, how education and training might address skills deficits, necessary research and development and the potential for Irish firms to bid for public procurement opportunities throughout the EU. We are determined to guide our economic development and well-being on to a sustainable and low carbon path. By successfully developing a thriving green technology sector, we can look forward to making a significant contribution to emission reductions.

The State already plays a direct role in the economic life of the country. It directly purchases products and engages services through public procurement. The Government is currently considering how our public service can give greater consideration to environmental impacts in its procurement arrangements. This has the potential to play a significant role in giving an incentive to companies to improve their environmental performance, leading to reductions in emissions, and in assisting Irish companies in successful international public procurement competitions.

I do not under estimate the scale of the environmental challenges we face, nor am I under any illusion about the uphill struggle we have in tackling our climate change emissions. The modest steps we are taking, which are undoubtedly an improvement on what has gone before, will not be enough to achieve the type of emission reductions we require. We must be much more radical. The introduction of a carbon levy next year will be an important step, but it is only one step in what has to be a fundamental multi-faceted approach, involving all Departments.

I have been campaigning on environmental issues for all of my adult life and I know what must be done. We have very little time to do it. It is worth making the effort even if it is at times frustrating. I retain the hope that we can work together on these very important issues on a non-partisan basis.

If the Deputies have any ideas on this subject, I will listen to them any time.

I will now comment on some specific aspects of my Department’s Estimates. I will concentrate on the principal sectors within my Department’s broad remit. In 2009, my Department will continue to advance the protection of our environment and ensure compliance with EU standards with regard to water, waste and species protection. My policies and programmes will be framed against the background of the state of the environment report, Ireland’s Environment, published last week. This is the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment of our environment available.

The provision of €560 million for 2009 is the highest ever for water services infrastructure, representing an increase of 19% over 2008. Against the present economic backdrop this is the clearest possible statement by the Government of the priority we are giving to preserving and protecting our water resources as a key element of our environment——

——to meeting EU standards for drinking water and waste water treatment and to providing critical infrastructure that will ensure ongoing support for the economy. Good quality water and waste water services are vital for housing, industrial and commercial development. A recent Forfás report helps to identify key locations where improved water services will be needed to capitalise on potential investment in new jobs and services in the future. The record 2009 allocation means that the resources will be available to meet these challenges and to deal with the water services requirements of smaller towns and villages up and down the country.

This Exchequer support for water services is backed up by the greatly improved supervisory structures I have put in place to ensure an optimum return from the investment, both in terms of service to the consumer and environmental protection. I have provided the Environmental Protection Agency with the resources to ensure it can effectively carry out the new supervisory functions given to it under the drinking water regulations.

The agency and local authority response to recent lead excesses in certain water supplies is evidence of the effectiveness of this new regime. It also reminds us of the fundamental necessity to ensure that the quality of our drinking water supplies meets the highest standards. In that context, I recently announced a wide range of additional measures to secure universal compliance with drinking water standards, including accelerated progress with key schemes and immediate remedial measures to respond to potential risks identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Drinking water quality data will also soon be available on local authority websites for everyone to see, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. On the waste water side, discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants are now subject to licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency to guarantee conformity with effluent standards and to protect the quality of the receiving waters.

The Environmental Protection Agency is central to our efforts to protect and enhance our environment. The 2008 Exchequer provision for the agency of almost €35 million, together with its income from licensing and the environment fund, positions it well to continue to carry out its very important environmental functions on our behalf.

This year has seen major advances in the development of our built heritage programme. In addition to providing ongoing support for the civic structures and architectural conservation grants schemes, I have also been in a position to progress new funding programmes such as the places of public worship fund and the INSTAR archaeological research fund. The provision of more than €25 million for built heritage in 2009 will consolidate the progress made during 2008. Next year’s allocation for the Heritage Council of more than €11 million will allow the council to progress key initiatives such as the buildings-at-risk programme.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department is responsible for the provision of front-line services for the protection of nature. It enforces habitat and species protection, in addition to providing expertise and advice to Departments——

——landowners, farmers, local authorities and other stakeholders in regard to protecting sensitive sites and species.

In 2008, I gave priority to work that will enable us to meet our obligations under the EU birds and habitats directives, through measures such as the reallocation of resources to high-priority areas and through putting in place pressing conservation initiatives. This will remain my focus in 2009. Substantial funding will continue to be made available for the protection of Ireland’s wildlife and habitats, necessary research, surveying and monitoring, the bog compensation scheme and agri-environmental measures to protect specific habitats and species.

However difficult the economic transition we are experiencing may be, there are certain priorities that must always remain at the top of the political agenda. That is why, in the overall financial provision for housing in 2009, our focus is on utilising the very significant resources that will be available in a way that takes account of the needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society.

The total Exchequer provision for housing will be almost €1.66 billion in current and capital finance. By any measure, this is a very significant sum. It will allow for the progress made in 2008, when the needs of almost 18,300 households were met through the broad range of social and affordable housing programmes, to be further built on.

The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Finneran, will soon announce details of an expansion of the existing local authority mortgage scheme. It will be a targeted and time-limited initiative to reflect the fact that access to mortgage finance has perhaps become an even greater obstacle to house purchase for first-time buyers than affordability.

The scheme has been carefully framed to offer a line of credit to households who have made the decision to enter the market at this time but who are unable to do so because of the credit crunch.

The scheme will facilitate, and not incentivise, the home-ownership aspirations of these households to avoid any distortional impact on the correction that is under way in the housing market.

Significant financial challenges face local government over the coming years resulting from the downturn in the economic cycle.

There are significant financial challenges——

——facing local government over the coming years resulting from the downturn in the economic cycle. In working together at central and local levels to deal responsibly with the current economic challenges, the same principles I outlined in regard to the Government’s budgetary strategy apply. Local authorities will work to ensure that they are in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the economy as it recovers during the period ahead.

Local government has benefited greatly from the additional resources devoted to it in recent years and it is now on a considerably sounder financial footing. Local authorities will spend well some €11.5 billion in 2008 in both capital and current expenditure. Even with the necessary adjustments arising from this budget, local authorities will still be very significant economic players locally and nationally.

I will announce my local government fund allocations to local authorities shortly to allow elected members and officials the time necessary to frame productive and prudent budgets for 2009.

This Government has had to make very difficult choices——

——in framing the national budget. Local authority members will face some of the same challenges as they seek to cope with the less favourable economic and financial position in their annual budget processes. It is important that local authority members of all parties show leadership at local level and do not shy away from the difficult choices required.

The fiscal position of the Exchequer is extremely difficult. We have had to examine carefully all spending lines and all potential revenue sources. Expanding the revenue base of local authorities is a progressive step.

The announcement in yesterday’s budget that a new charge is to be introduced for non-principal private residences represents a significant step in the expansion of that base. What we have done is simple and equitable. It will share the burden more broadly and serve us well for the future.

A charge of €200 per annum is being introduced for all non-principal private residences. It will be levied and collected by local authorities and, on a conservative estimate, will yield €40 million per annum. The revenue stream will be used to contribute to the Exchequer funding to local authorities for operational costs. Liability for payment of the charge will lie with property owners and not with the occupiers.

I intend to ask the Government to approve legislation to give effect to this measure in the near future so the charge can be applied from 2009 and the House will have an opportunity at that date to discuss its details.

On the wider issue of local government reform, I have just concluded a process of public consultation on the reform options set out in the Green Paper. I am very pleased with the wide range of responses received. I am now considering those responses and am working, as a key priority, to finalise policy decisions in the Government’s White Paper.

The measures I have outlined show the Government has responded well in these difficult times by taking immediate action to protect the public finances while at the same time ensuring environmental and economic sustainability and protecting the most vulnerable in society.
