This budget is a disgrace. It is a full-frontal attack on the lowest income earners, those who are unemployed and those who are dependent on social welfare. What it amounts to is a recipe for economic suicide. It is another deflationary budget being brought in by this Government.

It is being brought in by a Government which claims to act in the national interest, by a political party which claims to be republican. It is at times like this that one must ask what would the founders of the State think about what has gone on earlier today in this Chamber. What would people who struggled to bring the Republic into being think — the people who gave their lives and the people who laboured to bring the Dáil into being and to bring the dream of the 1916 Proclamation into being? We have not got their yet, but I am sure that they would be ashamed of what has gone on in this Chamber today.

Before I walked in here and before the Minister for Finance rose to his feet to announce this budget I watched our national flag being taken down above this building, and I am glad that it was done because what has been done in here is economic treason. Not only is the Government happy to sell out our economic sovereignty to the IMF, but now it is selling out the Irish people.

I think back to a poem penned by Pádraic Pearse nearly 100 years ago, “Mise Éire”, lines of which state:

My sons who sold out their mother.
That is what has happened here. The Minister has sold out the ordinary average people, who caused no harm to the Government and who have done nothing wrong in the State but try to get on in life. These people have tried to build the public services which we want to be proud of and have tried to go to school and to third level education so that they can be the entrepreneurs of the future. These are people who, through no fault of their own, are dependent on social welfare.

[50]The Government has decided in this budget to launch an all-out attack on those people while at the same time protecting the elite in society, protecting the backsides of Members who sit in this Chamber. I have read through the documents accompanying the Budget Statement. Not one penny from a Deputy’s gross salary will be reduced. How does the Government think the people listening to this at home or on the radio as they travel home from work can understand that a Deputy on over €92,000 per year should not take a pay cut but somebody on social welfare, somebody who is out working who has a child with a disability or who is on disability benefit needs to take a 4% reduction? Is that fair? Those are the questions people are asking. Ministers are talking about taking token wage cuts of €10,000, which, in reality,——

Mary, you are on much more than that and you should keep your mouth closed for just a couple of seconds.

The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, should keep her mouth closed while I am speaking because she is on much more than the €92,000 that Deputies get.

The token gesture that is being taken by Ministers in this budget does not go anywhere near far enough.

The Government is cutting the liveilhoods of people who are trying to get on in this State. What have they done? What have the public sector workers done to the Government that it will sack 9,500 of them — 4,150 from health, 1,023 gardaí who will lose their jobs by the end of next year, and 1,063 teachers and front-line staff working in the education system? A total of 9,500 public sector workers are to be made redundant under the Government’s plans.

What did the farmers do to the Government, which will reduce the REPS payments by €36 million? What did the students, who want to get educated in third level, do to the Government that it will increase the student fee to €2,000 and introduce a new fee for those on PLC courses of €200? God forbid, what did the primary school students do to the Government? It is introducing a new transport charge of €50 and increasing up to €350 the charge for those at second level. This budget is a disgrace.

Last year we heard the Minister for Finance tell us that the worst is over. Now we hear that low and middle-income families are to be hit with more punitive taxation increases and spending cuts. The Minister tells us that there is hope, but the only hope I can see is calling a general election. His Budget Statement is sparse in detail on the cuts but we can see in the documentation provided what these cuts will mean and how they will affect people in the years ahead. There is an €8 reduction for dole recipients, a €10 reduction in child benefit and €180 less in tax credits, excise on petrol and diesel is up, rental relief to be phased out, maternity benefit and adoptive benefit cut and there is to be a 5% reduction in capitation fees for student services and a reduction in student support grants. Some €746 million is to be taken out of the health budget. A total of one third of all of the cuts across departmental spending is coming [51]from health. This is at a time when the health service is completely buckled under the strain of the cuts that the Government has introduced in previous years.

Why are we doing all of this? Why is the Government introducing the budget that it has announced today? It is doing it to prop up a failed banking policy. The policy behind this budget is not only morally wrong, but economic sabotage. Some €6 billion is being taken out of the economy in the most destructive and damaging way. The Government has decided today that somebody who earns over €1 million contributes enough but a person on the minimum wage, a person on social welfare or a person who has lost his or her job must pay more. The Government has lowered the disposable income of every spender in the real economy. What that means is that there will be less money to spend in the local economies, which will turn the screw tighter on local businesses and will mean more job losses in small and medium enterprises. What the Government has done is prolong the cycle of recession.

I do not know how the Minister had even the neck to come in here and present such a budget. The Government has failed the people of Ireland. It has given away our sovereignty in the same way that its partners gave away our natural resources back in the 1980s.

The Government has brought the IMF and the EU to our shores, and they are here to help the Government to protect foreign bankers and to bail out the bondholders. They are not here to bail out the Irish people. They are here for our tax euros. They are not here to protect us.

What is disgusting about all of this is that when the country is demanding political reform, when people are shouting out for serious politically reform, the Government is relying on the votes of two gombeen politicians who want their own wee pet projects in their own constituencies.

The Government is willing to sell this budget. It is willing to sell the Irish people down the tubes for a casino in Tipperary and a nursing home in Kerry. Shame on the Government.

It is the reality.

I understand that I did not name the gombeen Deputies and there may be questions over who they are but the point stands. The fact is we can no longer afford this type of politics. We simply cannot afford it. We need a new type of politics.

During the course of writing the budget speech, did the Minister for Finance ever consider what it would mean to ordinary people on the street who are suffering because of what he and his Government have done? When was the last time he took a trip to a social welfare office and spoke to those dependent on the dole? When was the last time he visited a school completely made up of prefabs with more than 30 children in a classroom with only one teacher? These are the questions I would like to ask him. It is easy to talk about statistics and about people as groups but the Minister for Finance and many others in the Government are members of the political class and the elite. It does not matter to them what effects the cuts will have on the ground because they will never have to experience them. The same goes for the right-wing economists who will be cheering on these measures of austerity. The reality is that the Government and these Ministers will never see a dole queue. They will never have to choose between paying their bills or putting food on the table. They will never have to send their children to school hungry. They will never have to emigrate. What we will see is the Minister for Finance, his colleagues and the backbenches trotting down to the Dáil bar and celebrating another budget after which they will be driven home in their ministerial cars. They will take home their wages every week and when they retire or are kicked out of office, they will have a great pension to live on for the rest of their days.

That is why they are absolutely out of touch and why they will be booted out of office.

Last year, we heard the Minister for Finance tell the House that the budget for 2010 was the harshest budget that would be needed. What has happened is that the Minister and the Government have repeatedly misled the Irish people. If spending cuts were the solution then we would not have a deficit now and we would not have to be back here. We would not have a problem with our public finances. The clear message I want to give today is that there is an alternative and a better way and Sinn Féin has put forward that better way. It is clear, deliverable and costed alternative based on fair taxation, eliminating waste, growing the economy and creating jobs. Our alternative protects the most vulnerable but asks those who have a bit more to pay a bit more. Our alternative would see the cuts announced today reversed. I am calling on everybody going into the next general election and who wants to go into government to commit themselves to reversing the budgetary cuts announced today. No party can go into the next election campaigning against these cuts while unwilling to reverse them. Sinn Féin’s alternative says “No” to IMF and EU interference and tough luck to the bondholders.

They gambled and lost.

Their debt is bank debt, not sovereign debt and they have to accept a market solution to a market problem.

The principle of this is that the Irish taxpayer should not and will not be the insurance policy for the bondholders who took a gamble and lost. If we proceed with this banking plan, then the budget and the four year plan are already redundant. The plan aims to adjust €15 billion from the State’s finances over a period of four years. It is a figure that sits in splendid isolation from the €85 billion bailout negotiated for the banks.

We cannot afford this banking policy or the loan from the IMF and the EU. Most importantly, we cannot afford the Government. We need real negotiators to deal with the banks and not a red cent should go into the banks until their debts are restructured either through burning the bondholders or having a debt for equity swap.

The addition of €67.5 billion towards sovereign debt will incur debt servicing of huge proportions over the coming years, and we simply cannot afford it. It is important to emphasise that €17.5 billion of the €67.5 billion will come from the pockets of the Irish people. Who decided this figure could be lumped into the bailout from the IMF and EU? It is being presented to the Irish people as them coming in to rescue us. Again, we see a Fianna Fáil spin in action, trying to tell us that they are coming in with a package but in reality much of this is our own money that is bailing out not ourselves or the people being hammered by the Government, but bailing out the banks and bondholders.

Our public finances can be fixed.

The crisis we are in is the result of the Government’s deeply flawed banking policy. What the Government is trying to do is turn a banking crisis into a sovereign debt crisis and it has been aided by its partners in the EU. All of this is about political choices. It is about having the political will to stand up and put ordinary people first. That is what the Government should be doing today and it is what Sinn Féin would do. Those on the Government benches know the budget will cause untold hardship for hundreds of thousands of people. It will mean little hope of economic recovery in the years ahead. It is a disaster for society and a disaster for the economy.

It is a disaster for the young people who wanted to build a future here and it is a disaster for the families they will leave behind. The ESRI estimated that by the end of next year 120,000 people will have emigrated. It is 90 years since the foundation of the State and Fianna Fáil has once again used emigration as a safety valve at a time of rising unemployment.

These young people leaving our shores should be the next generation of Irish entrepreneurs, scientists, doctors, teachers and engineers. These are the people who can rebuild our economy and deliver the public service which the public demands. In this State, we train nurses at a cost of €90,000 per nurse and next year 90% of them will leave our shores while at the same time our hospitals will remain understaffed. I would say to any young person who is planning to leave to stay and change Ireland. We can get rid of the Government and it does not have to be replaced with parties with similar policies——

We can build a better Ireland.

We can be part of consigning the corruption, cronyism, greed and incompetence to history.

The young people of Ireland can be the new generation to achieve real political change and build a sustainable economy.

I know the Tánaiste does not like this. We all heard her on BBC speaking about how great it was that our young people were leaving Ireland but she should speak to the mother who is crying and who will never know whether her son or daughter will ever return again. Speak to such people and she might understand.

The people of Ireland deserve better than this budget and the people of Ireland deserve better than this Government.

Nobody should think

I will spell it out to the Tánaiste.

Nobody should think that we in Sinn Féin underestimate the magnitude of the problems in our public finances. We have a structural deficit apart from the banking crisis that must and can be addressed. It has been caused by the Government’s steadily eroding the tax base, allowing unemployment to rise and allowing a culture of waste and excess to develop in sections of the public sector. Latterly, it has been added to by the Government obsession of the banks and the debt servicing interest that will be incurred by this.

We can reduce the structural deficit but it must be done hand in hand with growing the economy in a sustainable way. Sinn Féin has put forward a six year plan to reduce the deficit to within the Stability and Growth Pact, beginning with an immediate €4.671 billion reduction of the deficit in 2011. This can be made if public spending is eliminated and the taxation system is overhauled. We have identified more than €1 billion in wasteful spending and more than €4 billion through making the taxation system fairer. When we put forward our six year plan, the Taoiseach excluded us from the talks in Government Buildings.

Fine Gael and Labour leapt on the four year bandwagon and were invited to join the consensus on cuts, which they did all too willingly. We said it could not be done in four years and that the cuts would make everything worse. What have we seen since? The European Union has already extended the adjustment period by a year to 2015 and it is widely accepted that even that is too optimistic. Again, we have been proven correct.

If the Government laid out a credible strategy to restore the economy to a growth trajectory, the bond markets would have more confidence that Ireland would be able to pay its debts and, therefore, yields would lower accordingly. The Government strategy to date has simply focused on the deficit, without enough attention to the wider economy which is the engine that provides both tax revenue and contributes to overall GDP. The deficit is a result of our economic woes, not the cause. If we treat the causes — unemployment and the tax collapse — the deficit will be treated. The four year plan is a joke. It is an accountancy exercise with no economic impact assessment. If taking €4 billion out of the economy in 2009 reduced the tax take by €7 billion, what will a €6 billion adjustment do? Also, it is based on the most ludicrous assumption of growth ever imagined by a Government about to slash the State’s finances. The Minister [56]announced average projected growth rates of 2.75% today. He should get real. The international community is laughing at him.

  6 o’clock

I now want to deal with some of the specifics of this budget. Bad economics, tax cuts, deregulation and tax subsidies for speculators during the boom got us into this mess and the bad economics of this budget, with its spending cuts, slashing of incomes and stealth taxes will dig the hole deeper. The four year plan indicated that €3 billion would be taken out of the social welfare budget by 2014. Details on what this means have been revealed by the Minister today. People have lost their jobs and these unemployed people are sitting at home tonight in cold houses. However, the additional €40 fuel allowance announced today will only go to households in receipt of the fuel allowance. The Minister pointed to low inflation as a justification for cutting social welfare rates by 4%, but prices for many essential goods and services have actually increased. All one need do is look for example at health, education, transport and energy costs, which have all increased.

A survey conducted by Sinn Féin of 278 social welfare recipients last week clearly demonstrated that families on social welfare simply cannot afford to take the hit. Almost 90% of those surveyed will go without bare essentials, whether food, heating or Christmas presents. How are people supposed to live on the welfare allowances announced by the Government? Cutting social welfare should be the last thing the Government does in a time of economic difficulty. Cutting social welfare will have a detrimental effect on the economy and society. Welfare payments are always returned to the economy. They are not saved or invested abroad but spent in the real economy. They are spent on rent, mortgages, food, utilities and other essentials. Cutting welfare is a false economy and will only cause misery and hardship for those on the receiving end of the policy. If less money is spent, the economy will contract, businesses will struggle and more jobs will be lost. More people will be reliant on social welfare.

Do these cuts make any sense? Of course they do not. However, cutting benefits is the policy the Government is pursuing. Sinn Féin is absolutely opposed to any cuts in social welfare and to the cuts announced today. We have shown where the revenue could be raised to ensure that welfare rates are protected. It is a matter of political choice whether to start cutting at the top where the highest paid and the wealthy can afford to take cuts or at the bottom as the Government has done, targeting those struggling to get by and barely able to survive from day to day. Any Deputy who votes for these cuts deserves to be kicked out at the next general election.

The Minister has told us that it is too complicated a task to make the tax system fairer. Why is it too complicated a task to reform the taxation system so that those on huge salaries contribute more, but not too complicated to consign the poorest to a life of scrimping, saving and poverty? If one looks at the public finances, it is apparent that we have less of a spending problem and more of a tax raising and retention problem. There is ample room for overhauling the taxation system, without turning Ireland into a high tax economy. Sinn Féin has shown how this can be done and how €4 billion could be immediately raised, with the least negative impact and effect on the economy. Instead, the tax changes in this budget once again target the least well off, those on the minimum wage and the low paid.

One of the biggest spins pedalled by the Government is that we must extend the tax system to those who do not pay any tax. This compounds the ignorance of the Irish tax structure. Let us set the record straight. Ireland relies disproportionately on indirect taxation and always has done. For every €100 received by the State in direct taxes, some €146 is paid in indirect taxes by every man, woman and child. These taxes disproportionately hit lower income earners. Yesterday, I was asked in an interview whether I thought such a large group should not pay [57]any taxes. I replied that it was easy to talk about groups, but that we should break it down and look closer at the issue. We believe that a person earning €300 a week already pays enough tax. Today, the Government has told us how much it thinks they should pay. This extra tax must now be absorbed into all their other bills, their rent, food, child care and electricity. Which service does the Government think they will think drop first? They cannot afford to drop any of them. The tax increases announced today are spread across the board and fail to target those who have the ability to pay. This is a big mistake, one that will damage the economy and consumer spending.

The changes in taxes and bands will be as follows, based on a 10% reduction. The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €36,400 for a single person to €32,760, putting more people in the higher tax rate bracket. The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €45,400 for a one income married couple to €40,860. The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €72,800 for a two-income married couple to €65,520 and the cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €40,400 for a single parent family to €36,360. It is clear the screw is being tightened once again on the lowest paid, punishing them for the Government’s incompetence and the recklessness of the banks, but there are no increases in tax for top earners. No 48% tax band has been introduced nor has a wealth tax been introduced.

The decision to abolish the income levy and health levy and to create a universal charge is a step backwards. This is a flat tax and this change will benefit the better off. The cost will be the same for everybody, regardless of their ability to pay. We did not support the income levy when it was first introduced, but at least it was somewhat measured, so that those on lower incomes would pay less and those on higher incomes more. However, the universal levy will in effect represent a cut for top earners, while lower earners will be brought deeper into the tax net.

The Minister did not mention any increases in VAT today, but we know they are coming. These increases will push up the cost of living, disproportionately hit low earners and will cause chaos for businesses, particularly those trying to survive in Border communities. We need to start from the top down and make those who have most pay most. That seems totally alien to the Government. A wealth tax could and should have been introduced as part of this budget. Wealth taxes have been successfully implemented in other European countries and form an essential part of those governments’ revenue streams. However, rather than introduce a wealth tax, our Government prefers to cut social welfare benefits and to drag the low paid deeper into the tax net. Despite the economic collapse, there is still considerable wealth in this State.

The top 1% of the population in this State owns 20% of all the wealth. Our proposed wealth tax would raise €1 billion at a conservative estimate in the form of a 1% income linked tax on all assets including property worth in excess of €1 million but excluding working farm land.

The Government could have introduced a range of other measures to raise revenue while making the tax system fairer. It could have immediately standardised all discretionary tax reliefs to raise €1.1 billion, introduced a third tax rate of 48% on incomes in excess of €100,000 to raise €410 million or increased capital gains tax to 40% to raise €240 million. None of these measures has been introduced.

The cuts to public spending bear no logic. The amount being cut will be detrimental to services that are already struggling. Health and education will suffer most of the brunt.

Salaries of public servants should have been capped at €100,000. This would have saved €350 million for the State per year. The Government instead chose to make aesthetic cuts to the [58]highest paid civil servants. The head of the HSE earns in excess of €300,000 per year. The heads of our semi-State companies earn more again. Padraig McManus of the ESB was reported as earning over €750,000 per year, at a time when this Government introduced three budgets that took the legs from those on low incomes or social welfare.

The Taoiseach and the rest of the Ministers earn more than most of their European counterparts even though they bankrupted the State. The Minister for Finance claims that very few people in the public sector earn over €250,000 but a report published in the summer found that 66 public servants in Ireland, including 37 judges, the head of NAMA and the head of the NTMA, receive more than €500,000 each. Even with the so-called pay cuts taken by the Taoiseach and Ministers, the Taoiseach still earns €36,000 more than David Cameron.

The Secretary General of the Department of Finance still earns more than the permanent secretary to the treasury and the CEO of An Post earns more than the managing director of Royal Mail. We still earn far more than our neighbours in these areas but the Government made empty gestures to address this issue.

The message that comes from this Government is that protecting its own backside is its first and foremost concern. The same sort of yapping continues to come from the benches opposite.

Through the successful efforts of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, our public health budget subsidises the private health care sector to the tune of billions of euro although not everyone can afford private health care. This is where savings could have been made instead of sacking nurses, cutting front-line services and closing wards and beds. That is what Ministers would have done if they had any moral fibre.

Once again the Government has opted for flat rate reductions in child benefit, which is paid to every child in recognition of the fact that this State does not provide free health care, free education or free anything for children. In this State, a parent has to pay a doctor an average of €60 to have a six week old baby treated. If the Tánaiste believes that some parents can afford to get by without this benefit, she should have gone after their incomes through the tax system. She cannot justify going after the payment in a way that hits poor and rich alike.

Health spending is to be cut by €1.4 billion over the term of the four year plan. The Government wants to take out €746 million next year. The health system is already in crisis, with services being cut across the State. I have seen first-hand in Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals the destruction that successive budgets have done to our health service. One has only to consider the distance that many patients are forced to travel to access health services, the length of the waiting lists or the numbers who are waiting on trolleys.

If these cuts are implemented there is no doubt that waiting lists will lengthen. Understaffing will result in further misdiagnoses and more people will be left on trolleys for days. These health cuts will cost lives. Even while waiting lists grow and patients suffer as they wait for operations, over 1,500 beds lie closed in our public hospitals due to cuts. The cuts in this budget will close hundreds, if not thousands, more public hospital beds. Prescription charges have [59]already been imposed on medical card holders while drug companies continue to make vast profits. In the past week an average of 300 patients were on trolleys in accident and emergency units in our public hospitals.

The recruitment ban in the health services means that fully trained nurses and doctors are being educated to the highest standard but forced to emigrate with their degrees. This budget will accelerate the brain drain from our health services. Supporting and funding preventative health makes sense and saves money. Cutting funds for these services makes no sense. Has nothing been learnt from the disastrous health cuts of the 1980s? The cruel reality in the years ahead will be that if one has money one will live but if one cannot pay, one may die.

Overall, this is a terrible budget for education. In times of recession we need to make education the gateway to recovery. Year after year, this Government did the opposite by imposing cuts on the disadvantaged, school buildings, special needs and capitation grants, as well as charging fees to students. This Government is intent on making education the preserve of the rich. Gone are the days of free education and back are the days of underfunded schools and exorbitant fees.

The Government is introducing an overall reduction of 21% in capital expenditure for education, including 9% for primary schools and a whopping 20% for secondary schools. This is a scandalous situation. Children will continue to be educated in prefabs. Money will continue to be wasted by being paid in rent to private prefab suppliers. Classes will be unable to cope with more children and less room. We could have invested in school buildings. We could have created much-needed employment in the construction sector by taking off the dole those who have skills to build schools and classrooms.

The capitation funding for primary schools is being reduced by 5%. Schools are already struggling with large class sizes and limited resources. The Government is now limiting these resources even further. The capitation grant pays for the day-to-day running of schools. The reduction will force schools to rely on families to fund raise in order to keep their doors open. Special needs education is being cut by 2%. We have already seen special education classes close down and special needs assistants sacked. What happened to protecting the vulnerable?

Grants to secondary schools will be cut by 9%, VECs will suffer a 3% cut and the registration fee is being increased to €2,000. This is tantamount to introducing tuition fees through the back door. The Government purports to want to build a knowledge economy. The reality is this fee will lead to thousands of young people being unable to attend college or get a third level education.

Once again the Government has brought forward a budget that contains no real funding for a stimulus plan. It has rolled out Minister after Minister to speak about stimuli. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have announced job creation numbers to beat the band but nobody has spelt out how this will work or how it will be paid for. The Government estimated in the four year-plan that there would be a 0.25% net employment loss in 2011. There are almost 450,000 people unemployed now, yet the Government is planning for even higher unemployment levels. Fianna Fáil and the other parties talk about stimulus, but none of them has real plans or costings to back this up. Sinn Féin has a plan. We propose a once-off transfer of €7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for a jobs stimulus. This amount is the equivalent of what was pumped into our banks at the start of this year. Instead, the Government is agreeing with the IMF and the EU in proposing to take billions from the same pensions reserve fund and put it into a black hole, which is the banking system. With the right policies and supports, jobs can be created in sectors such as agrifood, tourism, IT and green technologies. We can have a new generation of entrepreneurs and revitalise the co-operative sector.

[60]The Government can always find additional billions to invest in banks but it cannot find a single cent to invest in economic recovery. We have shown where money can be found. It is the domestic economy, in which people live, that is flatlining and that needs attention.

The public will not take this budget on the chin. They have forced the Government to call an early election and they gave their assessment of the Government’s budget and economic plans in the Donegal South West by-election. They have given their assessment and they will give it again in the new year, when the people have their opportunity to do so.

No one believes Deputy Michael Noonan will be a better or fairer Minister for Finance than the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan. His actions as Minister for Health give the answer to that question. Fine Gael subscribes to the same economic policies as the Government. It is farcical for that party to make a judgment on the budget. No one can understand why Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are still two separate parties. They are joined at the hip, as is seen in their policies.

It is clear that the Labour Party will accept and implement Fine Gael policies, because it has no alternative to offer. Deputy Eamon Gilmore’s personal ratings may still be high in the polls, but more and more people are beginning to see that the emperor has no clothes.

The Government needs to go and the budget needs to be scrapped. All parties need to give a commitment to introduce a budget after the general election to reverse these cuts.
=======
This budget is a disgrace. It is a full-frontal attack on the lowest income earners, those who are unemployed and those who are dependent on social welfare. What it amounts to is a recipe for economic suicide. It is another deflationary budget being brought in by this Government.

It is being brought in by a Government which claims to act in the national interest, by a political party which claims to be republican. It is at times like this that one must ask what would the founders of the State think about what has gone on earlier today in this Chamber. What would people who struggled to bring the Republic into being think — the people who gave their lives and the people who laboured to bring the Dáil into being and to bring the dream of the 1916 Proclamation into being? We have not got their yet, but I am sure that they would be ashamed of what has gone on in this Chamber today.

Before I walked in here and before the Minister for Finance rose to his feet to announce this budget I watched our national flag being taken down above this building, and I am glad that it was done because what has been done in here is economic treason. Not only is the Government happy to sell out our economic sovereignty to the IMF, but now it is selling out the Irish people.

I think back to a poem penned by Pádraic Pearse nearly 100 years ago, “Mise Éire”, lines of which state:

My sons who sold out their mother.
That is what has happened here. The Minister has sold out the ordinary average people, who caused no harm to the Government and who have done nothing wrong in the State but try to get on in life. These people have tried to build the public services which we want to be proud of and have tried to go to school and to third level education so that they can be the entrepreneurs of the future. These are people who, through no fault of their own, are dependent on social welfare.

[50]The Government has decided in this budget to launch an all-out attack on those people while at the same time protecting the elite in society, protecting the backsides of Members who sit in this Chamber. I have read through the documents accompanying the Budget Statement. Not one penny from a Deputy’s gross salary will be reduced. How does the Government think the people listening to this at home or on the radio as they travel home from work can understand that a Deputy on over €92,000 per year should not take a pay cut but somebody on social welfare, somebody who is out working who has a child with a disability or who is on disability benefit needs to take a 4% reduction? Is that fair? Those are the questions people are asking. Ministers are talking about taking token wage cuts of €10,000, which, in reality,——

Mary, you are on much more than that and you should keep your mouth closed for just a couple of seconds.

The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, should keep her mouth closed while I am speaking because she is on much more than the €92,000 that Deputies get.

The token gesture that is being taken by Ministers in this budget does not go anywhere near far enough.

The Government is cutting the liveilhoods of people who are trying to get on in this State. What have they done? What have the public sector workers done to the Government that it will sack 9,500 of them — 4,150 from health, 1,023 gardaí who will lose their jobs by the end of next year, and 1,063 teachers and front-line staff working in the education system? A total of 9,500 public sector workers are to be made redundant under the Government’s plans.

What did the farmers do to the Government, which will reduce the REPS payments by €36 million? What did the students, who want to get educated in third level, do to the Government that it will increase the student fee to €2,000 and introduce a new fee for those on PLC courses of €200? God forbid, what did the primary school students do to the Government? It is introducing a new transport charge of €50 and increasing up to €350 the charge for those at second level. This budget is a disgrace.

Last year we heard the Minister for Finance tell us that the worst is over. Now we hear that low and middle-income families are to be hit with more punitive taxation increases and spending cuts. The Minister tells us that there is hope, but the only hope I can see is calling a general election. His Budget Statement is sparse in detail on the cuts but we can see in the documentation provided what these cuts will mean and how they will affect people in the years ahead. There is an €8 reduction for dole recipients, a €10 reduction in child benefit and €180 less in tax credits, excise on petrol and diesel is up, rental relief to be phased out, maternity benefit and adoptive benefit cut and there is to be a 5% reduction in capitation fees for student services and a reduction in student support grants. Some €746 million is to be taken out of the health budget. A total of one third of all of the cuts across departmental spending is coming [51]from health. This is at a time when the health service is completely buckled under the strain of the cuts that the Government has introduced in previous years.

Why are we doing all of this? Why is the Government introducing the budget that it has announced today? It is doing it to prop up a failed banking policy. The policy behind this budget is not only morally wrong, but economic sabotage. Some €6 billion is being taken out of the economy in the most destructive and damaging way. The Government has decided today that somebody who earns over €1 million contributes enough but a person on the minimum wage, a person on social welfare or a person who has lost his or her job must pay more. The Government has lowered the disposable income of every spender in the real economy. What that means is that there will be less money to spend in the local economies, which will turn the screw tighter on local businesses and will mean more job losses in small and medium enterprises. What the Government has done is prolong the cycle of recession.

I do not know how the Minister had even the neck to come in here and present such a budget. The Government has failed the people of Ireland. It has given away our sovereignty in the same way that its partners gave away our natural resources back in the 1980s.

The Government has brought the IMF and the EU to our shores, and they are here to help the Government to protect foreign bankers and to bail out the bondholders. They are not here to bail out the Irish people. They are here for our tax euros. They are not here to protect us.

What is disgusting about all of this is that when the country is demanding political reform, when people are shouting out for serious politically reform, the Government is relying on the votes of two gombeen politicians who want their own wee pet projects in their own constituencies.

The Government is willing to sell this budget. It is willing to sell the Irish people down the tubes for a casino in Tipperary and a nursing home in Kerry. Shame on the Government.

It is the reality.

I understand that I did not name the gombeen Deputies and there may be questions over who they are but the point stands. The fact is we can no longer afford this type of politics. We simply cannot afford it. We need a new type of politics.

During the course of writing the budget speech, did the Minister for Finance ever consider what it would mean to ordinary people on the street who are suffering because of what he and his Government have done? When was the last time he took a trip to a social welfare office and spoke to those dependent on the dole? When was the last time he visited a school completely made up of prefabs with more than 30 children in a classroom with only one teacher? These are the questions I would like to ask him. It is easy to talk about statistics and about people as groups but the Minister for Finance and many others in the Government are members of the political class and the elite. It does not matter to them what effects the cuts will have on the ground because they will never have to experience them. The same goes for the right-wing economists who will be cheering on these measures of austerity. The reality is that the Government and these Ministers will never see a dole queue. They will never have to choose between paying their bills or putting food on the table. They will never have to send their children to school hungry. They will never have to emigrate. What we will see is the Minister for Finance, his colleagues and the backbenches trotting down to the Dáil bar and celebrating another budget after which they will be driven home in their ministerial cars. They will take home their wages every week and when they retire or are kicked out of office, they will have a great pension to live on for the rest of their days.

That is why they are absolutely out of touch and why they will be booted out of office.

Last year, we heard the Minister for Finance tell the House that the budget for 2010 was the harshest budget that would be needed. What has happened is that the Minister and the Government have repeatedly misled the Irish people. If spending cuts were the solution then we would not have a deficit now and we would not have to be back here. We would not have a problem with our public finances. The clear message I want to give today is that there is an alternative and a better way and Sinn Féin has put forward that better way. It is clear, deliverable and costed alternative based on fair taxation, eliminating waste, growing the economy and creating jobs. Our alternative protects the most vulnerable but asks those who have a bit more to pay a bit more. Our alternative would see the cuts announced today reversed. I am calling on everybody going into the next general election and who wants to go into government to commit themselves to reversing the budgetary cuts announced today. No party can go into the next election campaigning against these cuts while unwilling to reverse them. Sinn Féin’s alternative says “No” to IMF and EU interference and tough luck to the bondholders.

They gambled and lost.

Their debt is bank debt, not sovereign debt and they have to accept a market solution to a market problem.

The principle of this is that the Irish taxpayer should not and will not be the insurance policy for the bondholders who took a gamble and lost. If we proceed with this banking plan, then the budget and the four year plan are already redundant. The plan aims to adjust €15 billion from the State’s finances over a period of four years. It is a figure that sits in splendid isolation from the €85 billion bailout negotiated for the banks.

We cannot afford this banking policy or the loan from the IMF and the EU. Most importantly, we cannot afford the Government. We need real negotiators to deal with the banks and not a red cent should go into the banks until their debts are restructured either through burning the bondholders or having a debt for equity swap.

The addition of €67.5 billion towards sovereign debt will incur debt servicing of huge proportions over the coming years, and we simply cannot afford it. It is important to emphasise that €17.5 billion of the €67.5 billion will come from the pockets of the Irish people. Who decided this figure could be lumped into the bailout from the IMF and EU? It is being presented to the Irish people as them coming in to rescue us. Again, we see a Fianna Fáil spin in action, trying to tell us that they are coming in with a package but in reality much of this is our own money that is bailing out not ourselves or the people being hammered by the Government, but bailing out the banks and bondholders.

Our public finances can be fixed.

The crisis we are in is the result of the Government’s deeply flawed banking policy. What the Government is trying to do is turn a banking crisis into a sovereign debt crisis and it has been aided by its partners in the EU. All of this is about political choices. It is about having the political will to stand up and put ordinary people first. That is what the Government should be doing today and it is what Sinn Féin would do. Those on the Government benches know the budget will cause untold hardship for hundreds of thousands of people. It will mean little hope of economic recovery in the years ahead. It is a disaster for society and a disaster for the economy.

It is a disaster for the young people who wanted to build a future here and it is a disaster for the families they will leave behind. The ESRI estimated that by the end of next year 120,000 people will have emigrated. It is 90 years since the foundation of the State and Fianna Fáil has once again used emigration as a safety valve at a time of rising unemployment.

These young people leaving our shores should be the next generation of Irish entrepreneurs, scientists, doctors, teachers and engineers. These are the people who can rebuild our economy and deliver the public service which the public demands. In this State, we train nurses at a cost of €90,000 per nurse and next year 90% of them will leave our shores while at the same time our hospitals will remain understaffed. I would say to any young person who is planning to leave to stay and change Ireland. We can get rid of the Government and it does not have to be replaced with parties with similar policies——

We can build a better Ireland.

We can be part of consigning the corruption, cronyism, greed and incompetence to history.

The young people of Ireland can be the new generation to achieve real political change and build a sustainable economy.

I know the Tánaiste does not like this. We all heard her on BBC speaking about how great it was that our young people were leaving Ireland but she should speak to the mother who is crying and who will never know whether her son or daughter will ever return again. Speak to such people and she might understand.

The people of Ireland deserve better than this budget and the people of Ireland deserve better than this Government.

Nobody should think

I will spell it out to the Tánaiste.

Nobody should think that we in Sinn Féin underestimate the magnitude of the problems in our public finances. We have a structural deficit apart from the banking crisis that must and can be addressed. It has been caused by the Government’s steadily eroding the tax base, allowing unemployment to rise and allowing a culture of waste and excess to develop in sections of the public sector. Latterly, it has been added to by the Government obsession of the banks and the debt servicing interest that will be incurred by this.

We can reduce the structural deficit but it must be done hand in hand with growing the economy in a sustainable way. Sinn Féin has put forward a six year plan to reduce the deficit to within the Stability and Growth Pact, beginning with an immediate €4.671 billion reduction of the deficit in 2011. This can be made if public spending is eliminated and the taxation system is overhauled. We have identified more than €1 billion in wasteful spending and more than €4 billion through making the taxation system fairer. When we put forward our six year plan, the Taoiseach excluded us from the talks in Government Buildings.

Fine Gael and Labour leapt on the four year bandwagon and were invited to join the consensus on cuts, which they did all too willingly. We said it could not be done in four years and that the cuts would make everything worse. What have we seen since? The European Union has already extended the adjustment period by a year to 2015 and it is widely accepted that even that is too optimistic. Again, we have been proven correct.

If the Government laid out a credible strategy to restore the economy to a growth trajectory, the bond markets would have more confidence that Ireland would be able to pay its debts and, therefore, yields would lower accordingly. The Government strategy to date has simply focused on the deficit, without enough attention to the wider economy which is the engine that provides both tax revenue and contributes to overall GDP. The deficit is a result of our economic woes, not the cause. If we treat the causes — unemployment and the tax collapse — the deficit will be treated. The four year plan is a joke. It is an accountancy exercise with no economic impact assessment. If taking €4 billion out of the economy in 2009 reduced the tax take by €7 billion, what will a €6 billion adjustment do? Also, it is based on the most ludicrous assumption of growth ever imagined by a Government about to slash the State’s finances. The Minister [56]announced average projected growth rates of 2.75% today. He should get real. The international community is laughing at him.

  6 o’clock

I now want to deal with some of the specifics of this budget. Bad economics, tax cuts, deregulation and tax subsidies for speculators during the boom got us into this mess and the bad economics of this budget, with its spending cuts, slashing of incomes and stealth taxes will dig the hole deeper. The four year plan indicated that €3 billion would be taken out of the social welfare budget by 2014. Details on what this means have been revealed by the Minister today. People have lost their jobs and these unemployed people are sitting at home tonight in cold houses. However, the additional €40 fuel allowance announced today will only go to households in receipt of the fuel allowance. The Minister pointed to low inflation as a justification for cutting social welfare rates by 4%, but prices for many essential goods and services have actually increased. All one need do is look for example at health, education, transport and energy costs, which have all increased.

A survey conducted by Sinn Féin of 278 social welfare recipients last week clearly demonstrated that families on social welfare simply cannot afford to take the hit. Almost 90% of those surveyed will go without bare essentials, whether food, heating or Christmas presents. How are people supposed to live on the welfare allowances announced by the Government? Cutting social welfare should be the last thing the Government does in a time of economic difficulty. Cutting social welfare will have a detrimental effect on the economy and society. Welfare payments are always returned to the economy. They are not saved or invested abroad but spent in the real economy. They are spent on rent, mortgages, food, utilities and other essentials. Cutting welfare is a false economy and will only cause misery and hardship for those on the receiving end of the policy. If less money is spent, the economy will contract, businesses will struggle and more jobs will be lost. More people will be reliant on social welfare.

Do these cuts make any sense? Of course they do not. However, cutting benefits is the policy the Government is pursuing. Sinn Féin is absolutely opposed to any cuts in social welfare and to the cuts announced today. We have shown where the revenue could be raised to ensure that welfare rates are protected. It is a matter of political choice whether to start cutting at the top where the highest paid and the wealthy can afford to take cuts or at the bottom as the Government has done, targeting those struggling to get by and barely able to survive from day to day. Any Deputy who votes for these cuts deserves to be kicked out at the next general election.

The Minister has told us that it is too complicated a task to make the tax system fairer. Why is it too complicated a task to reform the taxation system so that those on huge salaries contribute more, but not too complicated to consign the poorest to a life of scrimping, saving and poverty? If one looks at the public finances, it is apparent that we have less of a spending problem and more of a tax raising and retention problem. There is ample room for overhauling the taxation system, without turning Ireland into a high tax economy. Sinn Féin has shown how this can be done and how €4 billion could be immediately raised, with the least negative impact and effect on the economy. Instead, the tax changes in this budget once again target the least well off, those on the minimum wage and the low paid.

One of the biggest spins pedalled by the Government is that we must extend the tax system to those who do not pay any tax. This compounds the ignorance of the Irish tax structure. Let us set the record straight. Ireland relies disproportionately on indirect taxation and always has done. For every €100 received by the State in direct taxes, some €146 is paid in indirect taxes by every man, woman and child. These taxes disproportionately hit lower income earners. Yesterday, I was asked in an interview whether I thought such a large group should not pay [57]any taxes. I replied that it was easy to talk about groups, but that we should break it down and look closer at the issue. We believe that a person earning €300 a week already pays enough tax. Today, the Government has told us how much it thinks they should pay. This extra tax must now be absorbed into all their other bills, their rent, food, child care and electricity. Which service does the Government think they will think drop first? They cannot afford to drop any of them. The tax increases announced today are spread across the board and fail to target those who have the ability to pay. This is a big mistake, one that will damage the economy and consumer spending.

The changes in taxes and bands will be as follows, based on a 10% reduction. The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €36,400 for a single person to €32,760, putting more people in the higher tax rate bracket. The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €45,400 for a one income married couple to €40,860. The cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €72,800 for a two-income married couple to €65,520 and the cut off point for the standard rate tax band will be reduced from €40,400 for a single parent family to €36,360. It is clear the screw is being tightened once again on the lowest paid, punishing them for the Government’s incompetence and the recklessness of the banks, but there are no increases in tax for top earners. No 48% tax band has been introduced nor has a wealth tax been introduced.

The decision to abolish the income levy and health levy and to create a universal charge is a step backwards. This is a flat tax and this change will benefit the better off. The cost will be the same for everybody, regardless of their ability to pay. We did not support the income levy when it was first introduced, but at least it was somewhat measured, so that those on lower incomes would pay less and those on higher incomes more. However, the universal levy will in effect represent a cut for top earners, while lower earners will be brought deeper into the tax net.

The Minister did not mention any increases in VAT today, but we know they are coming. These increases will push up the cost of living, disproportionately hit low earners and will cause chaos for businesses, particularly those trying to survive in Border communities. We need to start from the top down and make those who have most pay most. That seems totally alien to the Government. A wealth tax could and should have been introduced as part of this budget. Wealth taxes have been successfully implemented in other European countries and form an essential part of those governments’ revenue streams. However, rather than introduce a wealth tax, our Government prefers to cut social welfare benefits and to drag the low paid deeper into the tax net. Despite the economic collapse, there is still considerable wealth in this State.

The top 1% of the population in this State owns 20% of all the wealth. Our proposed wealth tax would raise €1 billion at a conservative estimate in the form of a 1% income linked tax on all assets including property worth in excess of €1 million but excluding working farm land.

The Government could have introduced a range of other measures to raise revenue while making the tax system fairer. It could have immediately standardised all discretionary tax reliefs to raise €1.1 billion, introduced a third tax rate of 48% on incomes in excess of €100,000 to raise €410 million or increased capital gains tax to 40% to raise €240 million. None of these measures has been introduced.

The cuts to public spending bear no logic. The amount being cut will be detrimental to services that are already struggling. Health and education will suffer most of the brunt.

Salaries of public servants should have been capped at €100,000. This would have saved €350 million for the State per year. The Government instead chose to make aesthetic cuts to the [58]highest paid civil servants. The head of the HSE earns in excess of €300,000 per year. The heads of our semi-State companies earn more again. Padraig McManus of the ESB was reported as earning over €750,000 per year, at a time when this Government introduced three budgets that took the legs from those on low incomes or social welfare.

The Taoiseach and the rest of the Ministers earn more than most of their European counterparts even though they bankrupted the State. The Minister for Finance claims that very few people in the public sector earn over €250,000 but a report published in the summer found that 66 public servants in Ireland, including 37 judges, the head of NAMA and the head of the NTMA, receive more than €500,000 each. Even with the so-called pay cuts taken by the Taoiseach and Ministers, the Taoiseach still earns €36,000 more than David Cameron.

The Secretary General of the Department of Finance still earns more than the permanent secretary to the treasury and the CEO of An Post earns more than the managing director of Royal Mail. We still earn far more than our neighbours in these areas but the Government made empty gestures to address this issue.

The message that comes from this Government is that protecting its own backside is its first and foremost concern. The same sort of yapping continues to come from the benches opposite.

Through the successful efforts of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, our public health budget subsidises the private health care sector to the tune of billions of euro although not everyone can afford private health care. This is where savings could have been made instead of sacking nurses, cutting front-line services and closing wards and beds. That is what Ministers would have done if they had any moral fibre.

Once again the Government has opted for flat rate reductions in child benefit, which is paid to every child in recognition of the fact that this State does not provide free health care, free education or free anything for children. In this State, a parent has to pay a doctor an average of €60 to have a six week old baby treated. If the Tánaiste believes that some parents can afford to get by without this benefit, she should have gone after their incomes through the tax system. She cannot justify going after the payment in a way that hits poor and rich alike.

Health spending is to be cut by €1.4 billion over the term of the four year plan. The Government wants to take out €746 million next year. The health system is already in crisis, with services being cut across the State. I have seen first-hand in Sligo and Letterkenny hospitals the destruction that successive budgets have done to our health service. One has only to consider the distance that many patients are forced to travel to access health services, the length of the waiting lists or the numbers who are waiting on trolleys.

If these cuts are implemented there is no doubt that waiting lists will lengthen. Understaffing will result in further misdiagnoses and more people will be left on trolleys for days. These health cuts will cost lives. Even while waiting lists grow and patients suffer as they wait for operations, over 1,500 beds lie closed in our public hospitals due to cuts. The cuts in this budget will close hundreds, if not thousands, more public hospital beds. Prescription charges have [59]already been imposed on medical card holders while drug companies continue to make vast profits. In the past week an average of 300 patients were on trolleys in accident and emergency units in our public hospitals.

The recruitment ban in the health services means that fully trained nurses and doctors are being educated to the highest standard but forced to emigrate with their degrees. This budget will accelerate the brain drain from our health services. Supporting and funding preventative health makes sense and saves money. Cutting funds for these services makes no sense. Has nothing been learnt from the disastrous health cuts of the 1980s? The cruel reality in the years ahead will be that if one has money one will live but if one cannot pay, one may die.

Overall, this is a terrible budget for education. In times of recession we need to make education the gateway to recovery. Year after year, this Government did the opposite by imposing cuts on the disadvantaged, school buildings, special needs and capitation grants, as well as charging fees to students. This Government is intent on making education the preserve of the rich. Gone are the days of free education and back are the days of underfunded schools and exorbitant fees.

The Government is introducing an overall reduction of 21% in capital expenditure for education, including 9% for primary schools and a whopping 20% for secondary schools. This is a scandalous situation. Children will continue to be educated in prefabs. Money will continue to be wasted by being paid in rent to private prefab suppliers. Classes will be unable to cope with more children and less room. We could have invested in school buildings. We could have created much-needed employment in the construction sector by taking off the dole those who have skills to build schools and classrooms.

The capitation funding for primary schools is being reduced by 5%. Schools are already struggling with large class sizes and limited resources. The Government is now limiting these resources even further. The capitation grant pays for the day-to-day running of schools. The reduction will force schools to rely on families to fund raise in order to keep their doors open. Special needs education is being cut by 2%. We have already seen special education classes close down and special needs assistants sacked. What happened to protecting the vulnerable?

Grants to secondary schools will be cut by 9%, VECs will suffer a 3% cut and the registration fee is being increased to €2,000. This is tantamount to introducing tuition fees through the back door. The Government purports to want to build a knowledge economy. The reality is this fee will lead to thousands of young people being unable to attend college or get a third level education.

Once again the Government has brought forward a budget that contains no real funding for a stimulus plan. It has rolled out Minister after Minister to speak about stimuli. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have announced job creation numbers to beat the band but nobody has spelt out how this will work or how it will be paid for. The Government estimated in the four year-plan that there would be a 0.25% net employment loss in 2011. There are almost 450,000 people unemployed now, yet the Government is planning for even higher unemployment levels. Fianna Fáil and the other parties talk about stimulus, but none of them has real plans or costings to back this up. Sinn Féin has a plan. We propose a once-off transfer of €7 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for a jobs stimulus. This amount is the equivalent of what was pumped into our banks at the start of this year. Instead, the Government is agreeing with the IMF and the EU in proposing to take billions from the same pensions reserve fund and put it into a black hole, which is the banking system. With the right policies and supports, jobs can be created in sectors such as agrifood, tourism, IT and green technologies. We can have a new generation of entrepreneurs and revitalise the co-operative sector.

[60]The Government can always find additional billions to invest in banks but it cannot find a single cent to invest in economic recovery. We have shown where money can be found. It is the domestic economy, in which people live, that is flatlining and that needs attention.

The public will not take this budget on the chin. They have forced the Government to call an early election and they gave their assessment of the Government’s budget and economic plans in the Donegal South West by-election. They have given their assessment and they will give it again in the new year, when the people have their opportunity to do so.

No one believes Deputy Michael Noonan will be a better or fairer Minister for Finance than the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan. His actions as Minister for Health give the answer to that question. Fine Gael subscribes to the same economic policies as the Government. It is farcical for that party to make a judgment on the budget. No one can understand why Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are still two separate parties. They are joined at the hip, as is seen in their policies.

It is clear that the Labour Party will accept and implement Fine Gael policies, because it has no alternative to offer. Deputy Eamon Gilmore’s personal ratings may still be high in the polls, but more and more people are beginning to see that the emperor has no clothes.

The Government needs to go and the budget needs to be scrapped. All parties need to give a commitment to introduce a budget after the general election to reverse these cuts.
