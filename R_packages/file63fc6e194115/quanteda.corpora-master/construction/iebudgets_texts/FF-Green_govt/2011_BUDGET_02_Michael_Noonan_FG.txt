This is the budget of a puppet Government, which is doing what it has been told to do by the IMF, the EU Commission and the European Central Bank. It is doing so in order that the State can draw down the bailout funds now that the country is insolvent. This budget is in an ironic way a fitting tribute to this failed Administration. Fianna Fáil, like the Bourbons, has learned nothing and forgotten nothing, and it is destined to continue its mistakes in this its last budget. These mistakes are easily recorded, but their consequences are tragic.

The Government’s policies have wrecked the economy, destroyed the confidence of the people, put 450,000 people out of work, forced more than 100,000 of our young adults to emigrate, increased poverty and undermined any concept of social justice in our society. The Government has made three major mistakes and it continues to make them today. The two harsh budgets, which were introduced to correct the fiscal crisis, were incoherent in policy and undermined their own objectives. The Government never learned that one cannot cut and tax one’s way out of a recession. One can only grow out of recession.

Consequently, its slash and burn policies were counter-productive and it failed to include measures to grow the economy and to protect and create jobs. The Minister has fallen into the same trap today — there is not a single progressive idea in the budget to support job creation or to get our economy growing again.

On fiscal correction, the intentions of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, were sound but his policies were woefully misguided, so the more he did the worse it got. Then some months ago the country became insolvent, or to put it bluntly, we went bust.

The misguided budgetary policy would not on its own, however, have destroyed the country. The destruction of the county is due to the fatal banking policy. Think of the hubris of a small [33]country guaranteeing €450 billion of funds, think of the decision to bail out Anglo Irish Bank at a cost of €32 billion to the taxpayer, and think of the extraordinary imprudence of NAMA. Think of the failure of regulation, think of the child-like belief that the banks were telling us the truth and think of the failure to hold anybody to account. Think of the decision to keep the directors of the banks in place and the decision to recruit new management from the second tier of existing management. Think of the failure in the third year of investigation to forward a single file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Think of the fatal ignoring of the principle of moral hazard, so that although shareholders were wiped out and those who borrowed recklessly were punished, those who lent recklessly were not punished but had their losses underpinned by the taxpayer. How could anyone have confidence in an Irish banking system underpinned by this set of policies promoted by the Minister and his colleagues in government?

The financial problems of the sovereign State were difficult but they were manageable. When, however, bank debt became national debt, the position became unsustainable.

The current budget deficit has shot up to 32% of GDP and the Government can no longer borrow. That is why it is out of the bond market because if it went to it, it could not borrow any longer. Ireland has become insolvent and that is why we have to be rescued by Europe and the IMF.

In case anybody on the Front Benches or the backbenches thinks that this happened by accident, it did not; it is a direct result of the Minister’s banking policies, which we pointed out to him, when he promoted them in the House, would not work. We pointed out that they would cause extra trouble and they have caused it now and that is how we find ourselves where we are. I wonder do members of the Government ever feel ashamed?

I felt ashamed when I read the obsequious letters of the Minister for Finance when applying for assistance to Messrs. Juncker, Reynders, Rehn, and Trichet and separately to Mr. Strauss-Kahn of the IMF. The first two sentences in both of the Minister’s letters reads as follows:


Ireland faces an economic crisis without parallel in its recent history. The problems of low growth, doubt about fiscal sustainability and a fragile banking sector are now feeding on each other, undermining confidence.
What a self-indictment; the Minister’s critics could not have done better. It is an absolute indictment of his own policies as set out in both of the letters he wrote to our new masters in Europe and in Washington.

If it was not so serious, it would be funny. When one reads the letters, they sound like confessions beaten out of him, as if one were reading a thriller. It is as [34]if they water-boarded the Minister in Merrion Street and made him sign the letters, or perhaps they were motivated by the mock humility of the gombeen culture to think that he would get the €85 million more easily if it was a handout.

Is this a hit me now with the child in my arms intervention?

The third and biggest mistake of the Government is to think that the purpose of all the pain and suffering is to restore Ireland to where it was in Bertie Ahern’s time. The dream of restoring a lost Camelot is always a huge mistake. Bertie Ahern’s Ireland is dead and gone and it will never be restored. The Galway tent is gone, the FÁS trips to Florida are gone, the subsidised travel from the SIPTU slush fund is gone.

The flipping of property in the fashionable pubs of Dublin after work on Friday will not happen again. The bubble cannot be reinflated and the Government policy designed to restore lost times cannot succeed. We need a new Ireland, a lean and more generous Ireland, where we support strong families and strong communities, where volunteerism is again honoured, and where people work hard and are rewarded for their work.

We need a reformed political system and a talented, fit-for-purpose public service needs to be developed once more. We need new policies to support growth and jobs. A fatal flaw in this budget is that there is nothing in it to get the economy growing again. The Minister will recall that even though his four year plan published two weeks ago is based on a growth rate in 2011 of 1.75%, on 29 November, the European Commission marked that down to 0.9%. His figures will not reach target unless we have growth in the economy. He has been advised of that by the European Commission and he is still persisting in proceeding without any growth or jobs strategy.

We need a fair and just society where the test of any policy is in the answer to two very simple questions Is it a fair policy and does it protect the most vulnerable in society? It is against these objectives that I intend to measure this budget.

[35]The Minister was very sparse in his detail today. Two minutes before he sat down we got a résumé of the main features of the budget. It is difficult to know quickly when he does not read out the major detail of the budget what exactly are the full implications of it. If we take the public expenditure area first, of the €6 billion correction, to which the Government has committed, €4 billion amounts to public expenditure cuts and €2 billion amounts to taxation. It is very difficult to know what the expenditure cuts are in the documents presented. We had an experience in the olden days when Mr. Haughey was king of the country where a budget would be presented and when we came into government we found the figures did not add up.

More importantly, there were no policy decisions taken to underpin the expenditure cuts.

The Taoiseach will be in here tomorrow and I want him to state clearly the policy decisions that will underpin the expenditure cuts registered in the tables at the back of the circulated document. I hope the Government is not faking it. I want the Taoiseach to explain the expenditure cuts.

I notice that in the four year plan there is a figure of €700 million for the sale of State assets. The tables in the back of the circulated document put the figure at €660 million but there was not one reference to this in the Minister’s speech. I am told the figures come from the intention to sell Bord Gáis and the Minister has permission from the European Commission to pay this into the Exchequer by way of dividend; yet the Minister was totally silent on it in his speech. When I see such things I worry about the accuracy of the Minister’s figures.

He made no reference to a reduction in capital spending today but a quick look at the tables at the back of the document suggests the Government is taking approximately €1.8 billion out in capital spending. He has not nominated the key projects in those cutbacks. Is metro north proceeding, for example?

Where will be the heavy hits? The Deputy will be walking home and will have no metro. He will be walking to Swords.

As two thirds of the adjustment to get to €6 billion derives from public expenditure cuts, there is an onus on the Government to explain the figures. As the Minister for Finance did not do so, the Taoiseach could come to the House tomorrow morning to spell out the policy decisions taken that will underpin expenditure cuts up to €4 billion. The Minister for Finance did not do it today.

The income tax adjustments are equally puzzling. The Minister stated he would cut the tax credit by 10%, which is fairly obvious, although the universal social charge is still a mystery. This charge, as those with a long memory recall, comes from an announcement last year by the Minister that he intended to put the health levy, PRSI and the income levy together. When questioned in the budget debates, if I recall correctly, the Minister said the tax-neutral position for this charge would be 7.5%. It would be tax neutral in that it would collect the same amount of revenue but have a distributional effect; it would be harder on poorer people and less onerous on wealthy people.

When I prepared the alternative budget proposals in the past few weeks, which were announced on Friday, we ran the proposals by the Department of Finance, which did an independent costing.

The Department of Finance was of the view that the tax neutral position is now in excess of 9%, and if one wanted to collect extra income one would have to go beyond that. Curiously, the Minister mentioned in today’s speech the introduction of a universal social charge but did not nominate the rate at which it would be introduced. That is not fair and when a budget is presented, it must be transparent. He cannot fool the people by announcing a universal social charge and not nominate in his speech the rate at which it will apply.

It is in the small print.

As Deputy Gogarty pointed out, the rate is detailed in the appendix. Is the intent to be revenue-neutral or is the intent to collect extra revenue from the universal social charge?

That is a very important policy pronouncement which the Minister should have made in his speech but did not. There are many issues not clear in this budget.

The Minister does not have a high regard for carers with his income tax provision, as the tax credit for carers has decreased from €900 to €810. On top of that, he has cut the carer’s allowance and did not exempt it like the old-age pension.

Carers have it tough and it is a vulnerable area that should have been protected. The Minister did not do so.

I am glad the Minister exempted the contributory and non-contributory old-age pensions from the social welfare cuts but he did not exempt widows.

Why would the Minister distinguish between old-age pensions and widows’ pensions? What kind of social compass suggests that widows can afford the cut and old-age pensioners cannot?

Why would he do this? Why would he cut blind persons’ and invalidity pensions, as well as carers’ pensions? The only exemption forced on him is the old-age pension. I do not understand why a Government would be so socially blind as to include vulnerable persons where the total tax take is so small anyway. The Minister could have got most of what he wanted from the main social welfare headings but he has hit invalidity and blind persons’ pensions, along with carers and widows. That is what we mean on this side of the House when we say the Government does not really care about the most vulnerable. Our policy is to protect the vulnerable in our budget cuts.

The Minister has cut jobseeker’s allowance by €8 and made no increase in the child dependant allowance in social welfare; it remains the same as last year. Child benefit is down by €10 per child for the first and second child. What has the Minister got against third children? In his speech he stated there would be an extra €10 cut from the child benefit of the third child only. The fourth, fifth, 16th or 20th child’s payment will not be cut.

Did some third child beat up the Minister coming home from school when he was a young fellow? What is the conspiracy against third children?

I have no vested interest as I am a fourth child.

Some of the changes in stamp duty are welcome as somebody has to act to get the property market going again. NAMA has destroyed the property market as it has taken everything out but put nothing back. Before leaving office the Minister should call people from NAMA into his office and tell them to put €2 billion or €3 billion of property on the market at fire-sale prices. These may be sold too cheaply but at least that would establish a floor in the property market and people would start again. Currently, everybody is watching prices continually falling and nobody will get into the market because they believe prices will fall further and people are waiting until they hit bottom. Somebody must put a floor on this and the only people with a big enough pool of assets is NAMA.

A tranche of assets should be sold, even if they must be sold cheaply, to get the process started again. The 1% universal levy on all property, with 2% on properties worth more than €1 million, is onerous enough. It means nothing now because there is no market but it will be a heavy enough charge when the market picks up. I suggest that in the course of the finance Bill the Minister should consider a capital gains tax on the family home, which would be much less onerous. The problem with the proposal is it will hit everyone who is in negative equity and all those who paid significant stamp duty over the past ten years. If one made the change through the capital gains code, one could exempt these categories, from which one would not make a profit in any case. I am suggesting an alternative means of raising tax through stamp duty.

Many of the changes in public service pensions had been announced. While public servants will not like the levies, which had been announced previously in the four year plan, many of the former public servants to whom I have spoken told me that, ultimately, they do not object to being treated on an equal basis with existing public servants. In the times that are in it I will not quarrel with that view.

The Minister did not do anything for people in negative equity, which is serious gap. The Fine Gael Party has a proposal in this area for which it will not charge the Government a penny if it is implemented in the finance Bill. If one were to increase to 30% the tax relief available to those who bought at the top of the housing market between 2004 and 2008, it would save those with a mortgage of €300,000 about €900 per annum. This is a targeted relief which one could pay for by withdrawing mortgage relief for sales completed from June 2011 onwards. My party had this proposal costed by the Department. Anyone who buys a house from next June is buying at the bottom of the market. They do not need assistance through the tax code to buy property because they are buying at knockdown prices. I ask the Minister to examine these proposals and try to make some adjustments.

The Minister proposes a whole series of excise duties. We will examine these in the course of the debate on the financial resolutions tonight. He has also made proposals on the salaries of Ministers and Deputies and proposes to cap public servants’ salaries. If we, in this House, do not start cutting our own prospects and salaries, we do not have the moral authority to prescribe tough medicine for others. It is not clear what the Minister proposes to do regarding Members. Will a Deputy of 30 years standing be considered a new Deputy if he or she is re-elected in March next? If so, will he or she be hit by the 10% reduction in salary for new public servants? Is that the Minister’s intention? The phrase he used is ambiguous. The position should be spelt out explicitly and without riddles because members of the public want to know what is happening with our pay and conditions.

[39]I thought the Minister would take the opportunity to introduce the changes in VAT he announced in the four year plan. It is the Government’s intention — it has negotiated this in the deal with the IMF — to increase the 21% VAT rate to 22% in its second or third budget and 23% in its third or fourth budget. While the retail sector will not like this change, much of the goods on which the higher rate of VAT is charged are imported. The Minister should restructure his proposal in this regard and try to do something for employment by reducing the lower 13.5% rate of VAT to 12%. While it should be reduced further, if possible, the Minister can certainly afford to reduce it to 12%. The lower rate of VAT applies to domestic sectors such as the building and service industries, including restaurants, the food trade, bars, hairdressers and newspapers. Service industries are significant employers who have low margins. A small adjustment in the VAT rate would get people back to work in these sectors.

I am not making a political point in stating that the Minister could introduce a series of supply side measures to get more people back to work. Reducing the lower rate of VAT is one measure that would work because it would reduce costs and get people back to work. The Minister has tried to achieve this goal by reducing the minimum wage by €1. My proposal is an alternative approach which would probably provide good value.

The Fine Gael Party has also proposed that the 8.5% rate of employers’ PRSI should be abolished for employees earning up to the level of the minimum wage. This, too, is a low cost measure which would save an employer who takes on a new worker €30 per week. It is difficult to employ low skilled young people at the bottom end of the market. For this reason, the Minister should consider what economists describe as supply side initiatives. While I am aware he does not have billions of euro to spend, the measures I propose are focused and targeted at increasing employment and securing more growth in the economy. They also have the great advantage of costing very little.

The Minister was silent on carbon tax. I thought the Green Party had convinced him that he should move again on carbon tax but he has chosen to move on excise on fossil fuels. He must make up his mind on how he will tax fossil fuels. Will he continue on the excise route or opt for carbon taxes? When one takes both options everyone is hit twice. It is not long since a significant increase in carbon taxes was introduced and now we have another increase in excise.

My primary objection to what the Minister is doing is that he does not have a jobs and growth industry. He did not mention the agriculture and food industry which is back on its feet, thank God.

Overall, the budget is incoherent, soft on the rich and hard on the poor.

The times ahead will be hard. The Government has sought to tie the hands of its successors with a series of very specific commitments over the next four years. If the Fine Gael Party is part of the incoming Government, we will stick to the targets set down but will renegotiate the specific measures envisaged for the next three budgets. I have been assured by Commissioner Rehn and Mr. Chopra of the IMF that they will co-operate with us in doing so.

There is a flaw in Ireland’s approach to Europe, one which arises from the hubris of the Celtic tiger years. Since we joined the European Union the Department of Foreign Affairs has taken the lead role in our relationship with the EU and individual member states. When Garret FitzGerald, whom I see in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, was Minister for Foreign Affairs and Taoiseach, it was common for Ireland to enter into infor[40]mal alliances with other member states, particularly smaller countries, to advance our interests. We had close alliances with the Benelux countries in particular. In the past decade we have lost our way and forgotten the friends who used to protect our interests.

At a time when boastful Irish Ministers could clear any bar from Berlin to Barcelona with their lectures on how to get rich through property speculation and how Ireland was the wealthiest country in Europe and a model for all to imitate, it was easy to forget our friends. When Irish Ministers were the braggarts of Europe it was easy for our friends to forget us. We must now mend our hand. Our skilled diplomats must again be instructed to build alliances with member states who share our interests. The central role of diplomacy in protecting our interests and relationships in Europe must be restored.

In this regard, it was disgraceful that Ireland was not represented by a Cabinet Minister when a major new initiative, the issue of euro bonds, was being discussed at yesterday’s meeting of the Council of Ministers. This is an example of neglect. While the Minister for Finance may have been busy with the budget, the document was completed at the weekend. Why did a Minister not attend yesterday’s meeting which discussed a far-reaching proposal to introduce a euro bond given that acceptance of such a proposal could solve many of Ireland’s problems? The president of the euro group, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, who is Prime Minister of Luxembourg, a country that is a traditional diplomatic friend of the Irish, was the main proposer of the introduction of a euro bond. No Irish Cabinet Minister was present at the meeting to push along a project that is in our vital interests.

Despite everything that has happened, I do not believe our country is ruined beyond repair. If it were not for the banks, our problems would be manageable. With the recently announced initiatives to downsize the banks, we can come through this. The foundation stone of everything is certainty. The Fine Gael Party is committed to reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014 and to a total adjustment of €15 billion because we want to give people certainty. Once we have certainty we can build confidence in this country. This is the reason Fine Gael is committed to an extensive jobs and growth programme.

Once we have confidence people will grow in hope and optimism and begin to spend and invest again. This is the reason the Fine Gael Party believes the marginal rate of income tax must be kept low, the 12.5% of corporation tax is an essential component of our industrial policy and the 13.5 % rate of VAT should, as I proposed, be reduced to 12% when the standard rate is increased. fine Gael wants a pro-jobs tax policy so that the economy can grow and jobs can be created. My party believes we can meet our budgetary targets for the next two years and we hope that after two years of meeting our budgetary targets we will be back borrowing in the bond market at a much less penal rate than the 5.8% negotiated by the Government in the bail out package.

Fine Gael wants the IMF out of here. We are an educated, talented, accomplished people, well capable of running our own affairs.

At times of crisis we tend to turn to the heroes of the past for inspiration — to Collins and Griffith, de Valera and Lemass. I know Members on all sides of the House do that and therefore I shall finish by reference to a quotation attributed to Michael Collins which we might all ponder. Collins said, “Give us the future. We have had enough of the past. Give us back our country to live in, to grow in, to love”.

Did some third child beat up the Minister coming home from school when he was a young fellow? What is the conspiracy against third children?

I have no vested interest as I am a fourth child.

Some of the changes in stamp duty are welcome as somebody has to act to get the property market going again. NAMA has destroyed the property market as it has taken everything out but put nothing back. Before leaving office the Minister should call people from NAMA into his office and tell them to put €2 billion or €3 billion of property on the market at fire-sale prices. These may be sold too cheaply but at least that would establish a floor in the property market and people would start again. Currently, everybody is watching prices continually falling and nobody will get into the market because they believe prices will fall further and people are waiting until they hit bottom. Somebody must put a floor on this and the only people with a big enough pool of assets is NAMA.

A tranche of assets should be sold, even if they must be sold cheaply, to get the process started again. The 1% universal levy on all property, with 2% on properties worth more than €1 million, is onerous enough. It means nothing now because there is no market but it will be a heavy enough charge when the market picks up. I suggest that in the course of the finance Bill the Minister should consider a capital gains tax on the family home, which would be much less onerous. The problem with the proposal is it will hit everyone who is in negative equity and all those who paid significant stamp duty over the past ten years. If one made the change through the capital gains code, one could exempt these categories, from which one would not make a profit in any case. I am suggesting an alternative means of raising tax through stamp duty.

Many of the changes in public service pensions had been announced. While public servants will not like the levies, which had been announced previously in the four year plan, many of the former public servants to whom I have spoken told me that, ultimately, they do not object to being treated on an equal basis with existing public servants. In the times that are in it I will not quarrel with that view.

The Minister did not do anything for people in negative equity, which is serious gap. The Fine Gael Party has a proposal in this area for which it will not charge the Government a penny if it is implemented in the finance Bill. If one were to increase to 30% the tax relief available to those who bought at the top of the housing market between 2004 and 2008, it would save those with a mortgage of €300,000 about €900 per annum. This is a targeted relief which one could pay for by withdrawing mortgage relief for sales completed from June 2011 onwards. My party had this proposal costed by the Department. Anyone who buys a house from next June is buying at the bottom of the market. They do not need assistance through the tax code to buy property because they are buying at knockdown prices. I ask the Minister to examine these proposals and try to make some adjustments.

The Minister proposes a whole series of excise duties. We will examine these in the course of the debate on the financial resolutions tonight. He has also made proposals on the salaries of Ministers and Deputies and proposes to cap public servants’ salaries. If we, in this House, do not start cutting our own prospects and salaries, we do not have the moral authority to prescribe tough medicine for others. It is not clear what the Minister proposes to do regarding Members. Will a Deputy of 30 years standing be considered a new Deputy if he or she is re-elected in March next? If so, will he or she be hit by the 10% reduction in salary for new public servants? Is that the Minister’s intention? The phrase he used is ambiguous. The position should be spelt out explicitly and without riddles because members of the public want to know what is happening with our pay and conditions.

[39]I thought the Minister would take the opportunity to introduce the changes in VAT he announced in the four year plan. It is the Government’s intention — it has negotiated this in the deal with the IMF — to increase the 21% VAT rate to 22% in its second or third budget and 23% in its third or fourth budget. While the retail sector will not like this change, much of the goods on which the higher rate of VAT is charged are imported. The Minister should restructure his proposal in this regard and try to do something for employment by reducing the lower 13.5% rate of VAT to 12%. While it should be reduced further, if possible, the Minister can certainly afford to reduce it to 12%. The lower rate of VAT applies to domestic sectors such as the building and service industries, including restaurants, the food trade, bars, hairdressers and newspapers. Service industries are significant employers who have low margins. A small adjustment in the VAT rate would get people back to work in these sectors.

I am not making a political point in stating that the Minister could introduce a series of supply side measures to get more people back to work. Reducing the lower rate of VAT is one measure that would work because it would reduce costs and get people back to work. The Minister has tried to achieve this goal by reducing the minimum wage by €1. My proposal is an alternative approach which would probably provide good value.

The Fine Gael Party has also proposed that the 8.5% rate of employers’ PRSI should be abolished for employees earning up to the level of the minimum wage. This, too, is a low cost measure which would save an employer who takes on a new worker €30 per week. It is difficult to employ low skilled young people at the bottom end of the market. For this reason, the Minister should consider what economists describe as supply side initiatives. While I am aware he does not have billions of euro to spend, the measures I propose are focused and targeted at increasing employment and securing more growth in the economy. They also have the great advantage of costing very little.

The Minister was silent on carbon tax. I thought the Green Party had convinced him that he should move again on carbon tax but he has chosen to move on excise on fossil fuels. He must make up his mind on how he will tax fossil fuels. Will he continue on the excise route or opt for carbon taxes? When one takes both options everyone is hit twice. It is not long since a significant increase in carbon taxes was introduced and now we have another increase in excise.

My primary objection to what the Minister is doing is that he does not have a jobs and growth industry. He did not mention the agriculture and food industry which is back on its feet, thank God.

Overall, the budget is incoherent, soft on the rich and hard on the poor.

The times ahead will be hard. The Government has sought to tie the hands of its successors with a series of very specific commitments over the next four years. If the Fine Gael Party is part of the incoming Government, we will stick to the targets set down but will renegotiate the specific measures envisaged for the next three budgets. I have been assured by Commissioner Rehn and Mr. Chopra of the IMF that they will co-operate with us in doing so.

There is a flaw in Ireland’s approach to Europe, one which arises from the hubris of the Celtic tiger years. Since we joined the European Union the Department of Foreign Affairs has taken the lead role in our relationship with the EU and individual member states. When Garret FitzGerald, whom I see in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, was Minister for Foreign Affairs and Taoiseach, it was common for Ireland to enter into infor[40]mal alliances with other member states, particularly smaller countries, to advance our interests. We had close alliances with the Benelux countries in particular. In the past decade we have lost our way and forgotten the friends who used to protect our interests.

At a time when boastful Irish Ministers could clear any bar from Berlin to Barcelona with their lectures on how to get rich through property speculation and how Ireland was the wealthiest country in Europe and a model for all to imitate, it was easy to forget our friends. When Irish Ministers were the braggarts of Europe it was easy for our friends to forget us. We must now mend our hand. Our skilled diplomats must again be instructed to build alliances with member states who share our interests. The central role of diplomacy in protecting our interests and relationships in Europe must be restored.

In this regard, it was disgraceful that Ireland was not represented by a Cabinet Minister when a major new initiative, the issue of euro bonds, was being discussed at yesterday’s meeting of the Council of Ministers. This is an example of neglect. While the Minister for Finance may have been busy with the budget, the document was completed at the weekend. Why did a Minister not attend yesterday’s meeting which discussed a far-reaching proposal to introduce a euro bond given that acceptance of such a proposal could solve many of Ireland’s problems? The president of the euro group, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, who is Prime Minister of Luxembourg, a country that is a traditional diplomatic friend of the Irish, was the main proposer of the introduction of a euro bond. No Irish Cabinet Minister was present at the meeting to push along a project that is in our vital interests.

Despite everything that has happened, I do not believe our country is ruined beyond repair. If it were not for the banks, our problems would be manageable. With the recently announced initiatives to downsize the banks, we can come through this. The foundation stone of everything is certainty. The Fine Gael Party is committed to reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014 and to a total adjustment of €15 billion because we want to give people certainty. Once we have certainty we can build confidence in this country. This is the reason Fine Gael is committed to an extensive jobs and growth programme.

Once we have confidence people will grow in hope and optimism and begin to spend and invest again. This is the reason the Fine Gael Party believes the marginal rate of income tax must be kept low, the 12.5% of corporation tax is an essential component of our industrial policy and the 13.5 % rate of VAT should, as I proposed, be reduced to 12% when the standard rate is increased. fine Gael wants a pro-jobs tax policy so that the economy can grow and jobs can be created. My party believes we can meet our budgetary targets for the next two years and we hope that after two years of meeting our budgetary targets we will be back borrowing in the bond market at a much less penal rate than the 5.8% negotiated by the Government in the bail out package.

Fine Gael wants the IMF out of here. We are an educated, talented, accomplished people, well capable of running our own affairs.

At times of crisis we tend to turn to the heroes of the past for inspiration — to Collins and Griffith, de Valera and Lemass. I know Members on all sides of the House do that and therefore I shall finish by reference to a quotation attributed to Michael Collins which we might all ponder. Collins said, “Give us the future. We have had enough of the past. Give us back our country to live in, to grow in, to love”.
