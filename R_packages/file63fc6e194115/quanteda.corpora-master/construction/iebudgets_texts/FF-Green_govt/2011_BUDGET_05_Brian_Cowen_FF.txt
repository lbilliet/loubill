This budget is being introduced at a time of great uncertainty across the economies of the developed world. We are living through an economic crisis with few parallels which is impacting in new and unpredictable ways on people, businesses and entire countries. Ireland has been affected more than most, partly because our economy is so dependent on international trade and investment and partly because of the scale of the fall-out from an overheated construction sector. It is the responsibility of those holding elected office to focus their energy on the future and to take action to solve the problems facing the people who elect us. That is the focus of the national recovery four year plan.

This budget makes the practical but difficult decisions that must be implemented to ensure Ireland recovers as quickly as possible. These decisions are not taken lightly. The Government is fully aware of the impact they will have on families across the country and has carefully considered all options and possibilities. We have taken these decisions in a way that balances the need to protect the most vulnerable, the need to meet our international obligations and the need to promote economic growth and employment.

The budget bears evenly on people and strives to share the burden fairly. Having stabilised the deficit this year, we have to take an important further step towards narrowing the large gap between what we, as a State, spend and what we take in. If we had taken no action, this gap would have grown again in 2011 from €18.7 billion to €22 billion. Our aim next year is to reduce the general government balance from 11.6% to 9.4% of GDP. As with paying a mortgage, the later steps will become progressively easier. With the budgets of the past two years, we were halfway along the path, with a €14.6 billion reduction since 2008. With this budget we are now two thirds of the way through the necessary adjustments.

Looking back, I doubt that any Government has acted so decisively and with such energy in a short period or done so much political heavy lifting.

It must be clearly understood that if we are to be in a position to borrow to maintain our public services, State pensions, unemployment benefits, schools and hospitals and pay those who work in them, we must adhere strictly to the agreed parameters of the national recovery plan we have drawn up and agreed with the European Union, ECB and IMF. The plan is the sole basis for drawing down the financial facility these bodies have made available to us. The front-loaded €6 billion cut in the deficit is the first and most crucial instalment.

There is no alternative option of €4.5 billion. If the Labour Party in government were to attempt to draw back from any aspect of the EU-IMF programme for financial support for Ireland without putting forward a full equivalent alternative, eurozone Finance Ministers would point out to it, in no uncertain terms, that it is bound by the scale of the commitments which underpin the agreement to provide support. If not, assistance would be suspended. Deputy Gilmore would do well to recognise his potential responsibilities and stop pretending to people in either a naive or deceitful way that his party has some other way.

[423]Despite the adjustments made to date, the economy is emerging from recession. There have been significant improvements in our competitiveness, as Ireland prices itself back into international markets. Our exports are performing strongly and have increased by 7% in the first half of the year. We are moving into a balance of payments surplus in 2011. Tax returns for 2010 are expected to be €450 million ahead of projections, while economic growth will also exceed forecasts. Unemployment has stabilised and the live register has fallen in each of the past three months.

When considering the challenges that lie ahead we need to remember how far we have come and the resilience shown by Irish people over the past two years. It is this resilience which gives confidence that we will emerge from this crisis quicker and more strongly than many commentators expect.

The national recovery plan published by the Government on 24 November is the basis for sustaining recovery. The plan outlines a pathway to restore the public finances by returning tax and expenditure levels to close to those of other European countries. Some €10 billion or two thirds of the budgetary adjustment will be achieved through reduced expenditure, with €3.9 billion of this figure being achieved in this budget. This means that by 2014 gross current expenditure will be back to 2007 levels.

Total Government voted expenditure as a percentage of GNP will be reduced from 49% to 36% by 2014. The remaining one third of the adjustment —€5 billion — will be achieved through taxation. The focus will be more on broadening the tax base than increasing tax rates, which is a more effective way of achieving revenue targets.

Tax receipts in 2010, nevertheless, will be 35% lower than in 2007, reflecting the over-dependence on property and construction-related revenue sources at that time.

A fundamental principle of the reform outlined in this plan is that all taxpayers must contribute according to their means. Those who can pay most will pay most, but no group can be entirely sheltered. The changes in the plan will bring the income tax structure back nearer to what existed in 2006. This budget is the first phase in this fundamental restructuring of the public finances, bringing them back to a sustainable position, while maximising the economy’s potential to grow and again create jobs.

We cannot afford delay. As of now, the parties opposite are not agreed on how much needs to be done or how it is to be done, as our previous exchanges amply illustrated. We do not have the luxury of time to allow all that to be worked out. Completion of the first steps towards the agreed target deficit of 3% of GDP by 2014 or, at the latest, 2015, will create the necessary breathing space, so that an election can be held and a new Government formed. We will not shirk our responsibility for the welfare of our people in the meantime. All sides of the House and people outside it need to be aware that restoring our country’s credibility, including re-building the confidence which is essential to recovery, depends on our being able to follow through swiftly on the commitments we have made.

The main task of the Government I have led has, from the outset, been to secure the best interests of the nation in the most challenging times. We have made hard choices and taken unpopular decisions in the interests of the security and well-being of our people. As a Government, we did our best to resolve both the banking and the deficit situations on our own. The interdependence of the modern world as well as our membership of the eurozone and large market movements have, in the end, put some of the solutions beyond our control.

Both the EU and the eurozone are themselves facing fundamental challenges in devising a fair and equitable response to a financial crisis situation, present and future, that may, in a [424]chain reaction, adversely affect several member countries. That our domestic measures did not prove sufficient does not mean they were not necessary. It was essential for us to make the maximum effort, which will now be supported by the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF. We are in a different territory from when such interventions were made in the past, for example, when Britain in 1969 and 1976 made application to the IMF at a time when we shared a common currency with it. For a small country, in particular, economic sovereignty has in practice always been somewhat circumscribed.

If we are to recover greater freedom of action in the future, as we all wish, it will not be done by a foolish and petulant unilateral repudiation of our obligations, for which there is no successful precedent anywhere, nor by a refusal to accept any share of responsibility for our collective actions in the boom years. Our situation will only be improved by following the route set out in the national recovery plan, of which the budget is the critical first instalment. Principally, what we must do to put our economy and our finances back on an even keel is to correct the overshoot wherever that occurred. A limited sacrifice in recent improvements in living standards will put us back on a path we can sustain. It is not about reverting to where we were ten or 20 years ago, rather, in most cases, to where we were only a few years ago.

I accept the argument that we have to start at the top. The Taoiseach’s salary is being reduced by a third compared to what it was in 2008, with net pay down 45%. The future salary for the President will be set at the new public sector ceiling of €250,000, which, when existing top level contracts in the semi-State bodies expire, will apply across the public sector, including to judges. I wish to acknowledge the President’s announcement that she will, on a voluntary basis, apply this new rate as she has accepted previous reductions. Ministers will have seen their net take-home pay reduced by 36%, while Deputies’ net salaries will have been reduced by a third.

Pension lump sums will be taxed above €200,000, and the public service pension will be reduced by an average of 4%. New entrants will enter at a 10% lower starting income. With the important exception of education, public sector numbers will fall back to lower levels by 2014, though much of the improvement in services will be broadly maintained. A more competitive economy has to reduce its overheads.

The cumulative impact of budgets since budget 2009 has been highly progressive, taking welfare and tax changes together. Changes in the pension regime are mainly focused on the highest earners. Twenty-four reliefs and exemptions are being terminated or restricted, including property reliefs. The cap on employees’ PRSI is being removed, as has long been advocated. In making the adjustments in this budget, we have protected the vulnerable as much as possible while continuing to incentivise work, jobs, and growth, on which their incomes depend.

Everybody pays something, but the better-off pay most. At present, the top 8% of earners pay 60% of tax. After this budget, the top income earners will continue to pay, proportionately, the most. Much criticized tax breaks which mainly benefit high earners will be largely eliminated. While it has been necessary to cut working age welfare payments, the 2011 rates will still be more than double the 1997 levels, compared to a consumer price index or price increase of 45%. Child benefit rates will be three times higher than in 1997.

To put all this in context, tax measures over the four years of the national recovery plan will bring us back to 2006 levels. After this budget, 38% of people will still be outside the tax net. The increase in numbers of people coming into the tax net at present is 45% and will be 38%. The new minimum wage level, designed to increase the availability of jobs, will not be in the tax net. The sum of €306 for a 40 hour week compares favourably with a single person’s job-[425]seeker’s benefit of €188. Despite the reduction, the minimum wage will still be considerably above the level in the UK and Northern Ireland.

In the debate, I cannot overlook the fact that the Labour Party is seriously at odds with Fine Gael as to the proportion of the adjustment that would be met from additional taxation. The Labour Party’s tax policy is closer to Sinn Féin’s than it is to Fine Gael’s. Fine Gael’s commitment is to confine tax measures to one-third of total cuts from 2011-2014. The Labour Party proposes that half of the adjustments will come from more taxes. It is worth pondering what the outcome of the Labour Party’s proposal of increased taxes might mean for average working families. If the party had its way on raising €2.5 billion in taxes as it proposed last week, and given that it voted against our proposals, this could, for example, involve a 2% increase on the standard rate of income tax, a 5% increase on the higher rate, or 1% on the lower rate and 3% on the higher rate in addition to a further 2% increase on the standard VAT rate to 25% with implications for competition across the Border, as well as a site value tax of €400, not the €200 average. In spite of claims that the target would be the well-off, experience shows that the average PAYE taxpayer has always fared worse when the Labour Party was in Government.

A priority for this Government is to protect the most vulnerable in our society, while ensuring that those of us who can afford to carry the heaviest burden do so. An additional €10 million has been provided for the disability sector. We have also prioritised the free pre-school education programme. We have not reduced the contributory old age pension in order that those in our elderly community who are unable to work to improve their incomes are protected. We have also increased funding by €8 million to allow for more home help packages in 2011. We have provided increased funding of €115 million for an additional 120,000 medical cards next year, and additional funding for the following key priority services: older people —€ 14 million; the fair deal — another €6 million; cancer —€8 million; child protection, as per the Ryan report recommendations —€9 million and suicide prevention —€1 million.

The reductions in many social welfare payments are a regrettable but necessary, part of this adjustment. Budget 2011 has to be seen in the context of the recently published National Recovery Plan 2011-2014. As the Department of Social Protection is the biggest spending Department, accounting for approximately 38% of total gross Government expenditure, it is not possible to stabilise and reduce our public spending without there being an impact on that Department’s budget. Failure to take action now in regard to the level of expenditure by the Department would mean that supports to pensioners, carers, people with disabilities and jobseekers, among others, would become increasingly unsustainable.

There was a common consensus to protect State pensions and we did that. However, that narrows the range of where we can make savings. Jobseekers have already borne a burden in terms of cuts, but the more areas are exempted the more are jobseekers put in the firing line for greater cuts. The unvarnished facts are that to avoid cuts in widows’ and widowers’ pensions, blind pensions and long-term invalidity, disability and carers’ payments, it would have been necessary to implement a far higher cut on the jobseekers’ payments.

“So what?” somebody says. One would be talking about a cut of approximately €11 per week on jobseekers’ payments instead of the proposed €8 per week, which would involve a €19 cut for a couple. Where else in the social welfare budget, over and above what we have done, would the Opposition make these cuts?

[426]The Government, in a hugely challenging budgetary environment, has done its utmost to protect the most vulnerable in our society in these circumstances. The adjustments we have made cannot be viewed in isolation and must also be seen in the context of the fact that over the past decade the Government has trebled the social welfare budget, whereas, over the same period, prices of goods and services have increased by less than a third. The total increase in social welfare expenditure has gone from €6.7 billion in 2000 to a total expenditure of €20.9 billion in 2010. In that time, the Government has significantly extended coverage, removed barriers and increased entitlements, such that the level and extent of social support payments has been transformed beyond recognition.

We have maintained the half-rate carer’s payment for those who have another social welfare payment and find themselves in a caring position. We have maintained all of the innovations that were introduced by the late Mr. Seamus Brennan when he was Minister for Social and Family Affairs. We changed the system fundamentally so that a person is only entitled to one payment from the system. We made carer’s allowance the highest rate of social welfare payment in the social welfare code because we recognised——

Rightly so. We did it, and I am proud of the things we did during those years.

I am proud of the fact that in regard to education in the disability sector we spent €1 billion of an €8 billion budget in mainstreaming people with disability into our education system. While some say I should be ashamed, I am proud of all of those progressive social policies. The situation, and what we need to say to the public, is this — despite the economic tsunami that hit this country a couple of years ago and from which we are still trying to recover, all those social gains did not go out with the sea. Many, if not all, can be retained and many can be regained and improved upon when things pick up again in the years ahead.

While that is a commitment we can all make, we have to be straight about it. In their analysis of yesterday’s budget, on the one hand, Fine Gael says there is no need for any income tax increases and, on the other, the Labour Party says there is no need for any welfare cuts.

That is simply an incredible position to take 12 hours after one of the most important budgets in the history of the State being brought into this House and, thankfully, passed as a result of the democratic process here last night.

The levels of income support provided by the State to those on welfare are still among the highest in Europe, of which we are all proud. People who live in Border counties know what the social welfare payments are across the Border. Many in the North used in the past to look towards the Republic and suggest patronisingly that we were not capable of looking after our own people. The social policies we introduced in recent years were the right thing to do. When else were we going to be able to do this? If we take the decisions now, we can maintain much, perhaps as much as 90%, of those gains. However, if we play the game the Opposition want to play — the game of “No, there is some other soft option available. No, we have a solution here that does not involve you or the next person being affected”— then the rate of cuts will become far greater and more unsustainable far more quickly, apart from the fact we need to ensure the programme we have agreed is implemented as quickly as possible.

[427]We need to provide an input of confidence and to let people see that the Government, the country and the Dáil, however hot and heavy our debates get, are prepared to take the decisions that are necessary for this country to come through. That is what people going to work or staying at home today want to hear from us.

Let us have our differences but let us not get into a stupid debate or descend into the foolishness of suggesting there is an alternative Government available to this country in the months ahead that will neither increase tax nor cut welfare during the course of the coming year. It is patent nonsense and it needs to be seen for what it is.

As Taoiseach, I am deeply conscious that the adjustments in social welfare expenditure in this budget will affect the living standards of many of our citizens in the short term. However, if we put off these changes, there will be a greater burden in the future on all those who can least bear it. What is most important now is that we can sustain a strong welfare system into the future. These adjustments mean we have cut back slightly but they protect people from the risk of more severe cuts in the future.

We are keeping those who have lost their jobs as close to the labour market as possible. We are providing 15,000 extra activation places at a cost of €200 million on a skills and internship programme, a work placement programme and a community work placement scheme which supplement the existing level of activity. Since this crisis began, we have doubled the number of training places from 66,000 to over 130,000. To this can be added the thousands of people on the back to education scheme as well as the private sector labour activation scheme introduced by the Tánaiste when she held that Department, which is a good scheme and one which can be expanded and be part of how we deal with this situation for people who want to stay active and up-skill. Under the Department of Social Protection, there are 55,000 more places for people on community employment schemes, the community support programme and the rural social scheme.

Taking all of that, there are 205,000 places, together with the 15,000 announced here. When one considers that 290,000 people in this country are signing on for unemployment full-time, five days a week, it gives an indication of the level of response we are trying to achieve in very straitened and difficult circumstances.

If the Deputy wants to be patronising about it, that is his problem. The facts are that these decisions were taken by Government at a time of great economic difficulty.

Everybody recognises we have to provide as much support as we can. I looked at some of the proposals from other parties in regard to this matter in their pre-budget submissions, and they are broadly in the same territory both in terms of scale and objective.

We are extending the employer job incentive scheme to the end of 2011 and transforming the business expansion scheme to incentivise firms to employ staff. We are undertaking a number of key strategic initiatives to create new jobs and get people back to work. The business expansion scheme and the new employment incentive announced by the Minister yesterday require state aid approval, which should be forthcoming in the normal time period in the coming months. The issue is we are making sure that, as we close down the tax shelters in [428]other areas, we provide an opportunity for people to invest in those entrepreneurs, businesses and enterprises that require assistance and funding at this time. We are increasing the amount one can invest in overall terms to €10 million, and €2.5 million annually, where the current limit is €1.5 million, and dealing with a complaint from business regarding some of these issues. People are out there creating jobs in terms of the certification process being more streamlined and user friendly. We want to broaden the areas of activity the business expansion scheme at present includes and the areas where investment can be made. That is a good initiative and it is the right thing to do. Those with investment income are being channelled into those areas of best employment effect in the public policy area.

At almost €35 billion, we are maintaining proportionately one of the largest capital investment programmes in Europe. We will spend €4.7 billion next year on the capital programme. When we consider the difficulties we have faced, to listen to some of the commentary and analysis from Members, which for some reason they think is a good idea, they suggest that due to the economic tsunami we have lost it all. Have we been knocking down the new hospitals? Are the new schools being closed? Have the extensions to all the basic infrastructure developments in our towns and villages throughout the country been closed up? The answer is “No”. They have added to our competitiveness, and the people driving around the country today know this. To spend billions of euro in these areas was the right thing to do.

In current circumstances, as we know, there is greater value for money to be had given the more competitive position, with tender prices down by approximately 30%. We are continuing to work in that area. With regard to the €4.7 billion, whether it is the €400 million for our health programme, the €383 million going into capital spending in our schools, the €500 million being invested in our water services programme or the €500 million being invested in our housing programme, including for regeneration in Ballymun and Limerick, which is much needed, as we saw again on recent programmes on RTE, these are important initiatives. The Government is seeking to address issues constructively and is prepared to invest in the country at a time of difficulty. That is what we are doing.

With regard to semi-State bodies, the amount of investment that will be undertaken by the utilities, telecommunications and broadband companies, including those in the private sector, will be of the order of €2 billion next year.

Total expenditure on capital programmes through commercial semi-State investment and the public investment programme will be €6.5 billion next year.

That should not be regarded as something just to be sniffed at. It is important work building on all the investments we have made in the past. Unprecedented capital investment has changed the face of and transformed this country, much for the better.

If the capacity was such, it happened in the private sector.

Taxpayers’ money was invested in schools in the Deputy’s constituency and he has been trying to take credit for this for the past ten years. Taxpayers’ money ensured [429]serious investments were made. Why can the Deputy not simply acknowledge that and move on to the debate about the future?

The Deputy’s problem is that he is not able to move on because he does not have a policy framework that stands up.

I do not know whether the finance spokesperson heard his leader this morning.

He suggested that Deputy Noonan would not have to raise any money in income tax to make a cut of €6 billion.

Is that true? Could that be true? I refer to the man who was supposed to have brought some gravitas to the finance spokesmanship in recent months and who was ensuring the leader could step back a bit that we might hear a bit of common sense.

In the past 25 minutes, there has been a need to get an editor for him.

He has really gone overboard this time.

Our five-year integrated plan for trade, tourism and investment will create 300,000 jobs and boost exports by one third. This is based on the figures of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and on the spillover effect that can happen. We must be conveying to the public and investor community that we seek investment income for productive areas of the economy, not only at home but also abroad. If we are to continue to talk about economic corpses and state the country is banjaxed, that we should forget about it and that it will all change when the Opposition gets into power, we will not be productive.

If Deputy Gilmore is the good guy, we must be in bigger trouble than I believed we were in. Certainly, working people will know how the Labour Party dealt with PAYE taxpayers when it was in Government. This is because that party will not take the decisions to cut back on the services when those decisions are necessary. It piled the tax on working people. When Deputy Gilmore asks me to wait until the Labour Party is back in power, he should note that [430]when he was in Government, he taxed people who earned above €7,000. He started taxing people earning €120 per week.

We made changes yesterday.

One will have to earn €16,300 before one starts contributing to the tax system. This is because we wanted to ensure people on low incomes are helped, avoid poverty traps and maintain the incentive to work. Even after yesterday’s budget, in respect of which every superlative one could think of has been used in an effort to say how terrible it is——

Yet, 38% of people going to work today will not be in the tax net after this budget.

That is our commitment to these people. I will discuss that with the Deputy any time.

The Deputy does not have to engage in defence. The wry smile of the finance spokesperson said it all for me.

We have set up an innovation fund of €500 million that will support enterprise development and job creation by drawing top venture capitalists to Ireland. It is interesting that the first tranche has attracted 23 expressions of interest. That is the way we can get capital into high-technology companies that are presently short of resources and which find it hard to bank their projects because of the nature of the activity in which they are engaged. The research element must be borne in mind.

A €32 million labour market activation fund is targeted at specific priority groups among the unemployed, and is supporting almost 60 projects and 11,000 participants this year. This is an important point to make. The fund represents a good initiative that marries public policy objectives to private sector initiatives.

Under the four year plan, we will use moneys from the national pensions reserve fund for projects such as the water metering programme and retrofitting. Our low corporation tax rate of 12.5% is the cornerstone of our economic policy. Foreign direct investment supports 240,000 jobs in this country.

Both AIB and the Bank of Ireland are to make €12 billion available to SMEs over the next two years. We have remained true to our ambition to make Ireland a global innovation hub, a [431]country that can support high-value jobs based on innovation and knowledge. It is something to be said for our country that, at a time of such difficulty, it was first in the foreign direct investment stakes per head of population last year. Last year was one of the most difficult years we have ever had. We were so successful because, despite the difficulty and contraction of the economy, we continued to create an environment here that promotes enterprise and jobs and, importantly, looks to our own resources.

The tourism sector, for example, will benefit from a programme worth over €200 million. If one considers the change to the travel tax, which will cost the taxpayer approximately €65 million——

That is one aspect. With regard to promoting the tourism product in Ireland, the sum in question amounts to over €100 million. There is expenditure of over €40 million on tourism marketing. In this area, a serious, focused effort is being made to increase tourist numbers.

With regard to agriculture, in respect of which I will be glad to hear from Deputy Stanton, we have a strategy in place and confidence has returned to the sector. I recall meeting worried representatives of the agri-food business at the height of this crisis, at which time it was suggested that up to 40% of its base would disappear because of factors exacerbated by the exchange rate problem. This is because many of our goods and services in this area go into the sterling area, as the Deputies know. All of them have come through and all have growth strategies. I am thankful that primary producers such as farmers have had a much better year this year than in the preceding two. There is now leadership. I acknowledge the leadership in the farming community and agri-food sector. People in the sector are getting on with their work and saying we must move on and increase our output and job content. These are our own natural resources.

There will be considerable investment next year in the forestry sector. Shouting at me will not change this. Deputy Barrett should give me a shout when he is to make his contribution and I will come down and listen respectfully to what he has to say. He cannot make his contribution at the same time as I am making mine.

That is just not the way it works.

The Government is investing over €570 million in science, technology and innovation next year. We are continuing with that. When one considers the budgets for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, one will note the total budget for enterprise support next year is €508 million. It will rise by €50 million in 2012 and 2013 because that is the commitment we are making in terms of focusing on the promotion of growth and job creation.

[432]When people talk about the need to put jobs and growth at the centre of our economic agenda, we agree with them, but one cannot just ask where the stimulus is. The stimulus is that our competitiveness is improving and that we are investing €6.5 billion next year through commercial semi-State companies and our public investment programme. By any rule of thumb, that amounts to the maintenance of over 65,000 jobs.

If one considers the activation area, what is occurring under the business expansion scheme, the supports from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, the areas of science, technology and innovation and the work of Science Foundation Ireland one will realise we have a real economy that is forging ahead if we give it the chance. Exports have increased by 6% and merchandising exports have increased by 12% in the past three months. We will have a balance of payments surplus next year. While we must do our job in this House, namely, fixing the public finances, we must also ensure that enterprising, entrepreneurial businessmen and businesswomen, both at home and abroad, are supported in every way, including economically, diplomatically and by way of marketing. All the State agencies must be motivated to support Ireland in selling its goods and services globally such that there will be demand for them when we set the right price. This is what we have been able to do as a result of the policies we have been implementing. That changeover has happened.

Science Foundation Ireland will be maintaining 29 top-class research centres in 2011 and it continues to work with over 400 industry partners. This is important if we are to sustain growth. It is in this area that we must invest now if we are to secure the new jobs and services of the future.

Enterprise Ireland will help approximately 1,200 companies with research and innovation activities in 2011. It will also support 85 high-potential start-up companies next year, rising to 100 by 2015. I refer to scale-up companies in addition to start-up companies, as mentioned by Deputy Gilmore a few days ago. The number of industry-led competency centres will be doubled to 16 by 2015. Innovation Fund Ireland will grow to €500 million, attracting leading international venture capital companies to Ireland; and the IDA will continue to attract new investments, nearly half of which were research and development related this year.

Ireland is developing a strong international reputation for innovation and high tech start-ups. The smart economy can be an important part of our economic recovery, and the budget positions us to take advantage.

We are introducing incentives to bring confidence to the housing market, including a reduced flat rate 1% stamp duty rate on residential property transactions up to €l million; an improved tenant purchase scheme available now to 45,000 more tenants in this country who can obtain the ownership of their home based on a much improved and far more attractive scheme brought forward by the Minister for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran; measures to help registered tax compliant contractors; and tax incentives for retrofitting home energy efficiency measures are a way of ensuring that we reduce the black economy and make sure those who are compliant and are running their businesses properly, ethically and in a business like fashion are supported. By reducing the relevant contracts tax from 35% to 20% we greatly improve the cash flow of those businesses that are compliant and ensure we are able to deal with those who are trying to play it both ways using the system.

We are supporting tourism by reducing the air travel tax to €3, and the DAA will be incentivising carriers to bring in additional airline passengers.

I have made the point about the capital investment programme. It is critical. While difficult decisions have been made in this budget, and further challenging measures will be put in place over the lifetime of the four year plan, we have retained the vast majority of the benefits of the boom.

The tax measures over the four years of the national recovery plan will bring us to 2006 levels. Spending levels will be brought to 2007-08 levels. However, spending on the productive capacity of the economy will continue apace.

During the good times, we used the fruits of the boom not only to reduce our national debt to very low levels but we also invested wisely in the productive capacity of the economy — in schools, roads, public transport, communications, research and innovation, and housing. We retain this infrastructure, and that is helping to grow the economy once again. Anyone visiting this country now would see how much better served we are by that infrastructure compared to the 1980s.

We had one of the highest rates of public investment in Europe over the past ten years and we still have that now.

We retain a high level of capital investment by international and historical standards — nearly €16.5 billion in the period up to 2014. That will be invested in projects which support economic growth and employment.

Next year alone we will invest €4.7 billion. This will allow several new road projects to start, support major regeneration projects in Ballymun and Limerick, sustain the school building programme, and progress high priority health projects, particularly in the mental health area.

There is a major allocation for the new national energy retrofit programme. This will combine existing domestic energy efficiency initiatives, supporting jobs for former construction workers and making sure that the tax credit is available as well as the direct grant-in-aid through the various schemes. The tax credit scheme will be of wider application and bring in more types of remedial and improvement works, which I believe is necessary as people look now to improve their own housing situation rather than buying up. This programme will be complemented by a new tax credit for domestic energy efficiency improvements.

Most important, we have prioritised spending on enterprise supports. At a time of major crisis, it is appropriate to draw on all our resources.

We will continue to bring forward public private partnerships in transport, education and health. We will help to identify public investment opportunities for the National Pensions Reserve Fund and other private investors, and we will support major investments by our commercial semi-State companies — more than €2 billion in the energy sector alone in 2011.

The Government remains convinced that North-South co-operation is a central element in the push for economic recovery. Budget 2011 has maintained overall funding levels for North-South co-operation, with a total allocation of over €110 million.

The increased allocation of €14 million for cross-Border transport initiatives will help promote jobs and economic recovery in Border communities and the wider economy. This includes the necessary funding to meet the Irish Government’s commitment to the joint projects to upgrade the cross-Border road network, and we stand by those decisions.

[434]The budget also includes funding of almost €80 million for the North-South bodies. Of course, like all other public sector bodies they will see reduced budgets, but this substantial funding will enable those bodies to continue their essential work.

The future prosperity of the island economy is essential to building on the peace we have achieved and to creating economic opportunities for a new generation that can enjoy that peace. We will not let our economic difficulties distract us from that core mission of this Government.

As well as the work of the North-South bodies, areas of co-operation such as health and education, and joint investment projects, there is an increasing range of shared economic concerns between North and South in areas such as banking, energy and research development. I look forward to discussing these issues with colleagues from the Northern Ireland Executive at the British-Irish Council meeting next week and at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council, which I expect to be held shortly.

Our economy retains very significant strengths. We have the youngest population in Europe, with one in three under 25; we have the highest proportion of graduates among the 25 to 34 age group in the European Union; our exports are performing strongly; we are the ninth best country worldwide in which to do business according to the World Bank; Ireland’s stock of direct inward investment is five times greater than the OECD average; our competitiveness has significantly improved; we have clusters of the world’s leading multinational companies, and continue to attract high levels of investment. Almost 1,000 companies, including household names such as IBM, Google, eBay and Facebook, have chosen Ireland as the hub of their European operations.

A fair and effective budget will boost confidence and jobs. We need to start believing in ourselves again, particularly in the public arena and to communicate that with confidence to the outside world. I commend the budget to the House.
=======
This budget is being introduced at a time of great uncertainty across the economies of the developed world. We are living through an economic crisis with few parallels which is impacting in new and unpredictable ways on people, businesses and entire countries. Ireland has been affected more than most, partly because our economy is so dependent on international trade and investment and partly because of the scale of the fall-out from an overheated construction sector. It is the responsibility of those holding elected office to focus their energy on the future and to take action to solve the problems facing the people who elect us. That is the focus of the national recovery four year plan.

This budget makes the practical but difficult decisions that must be implemented to ensure Ireland recovers as quickly as possible. These decisions are not taken lightly. The Government is fully aware of the impact they will have on families across the country and has carefully considered all options and possibilities. We have taken these decisions in a way that balances the need to protect the most vulnerable, the need to meet our international obligations and the need to promote economic growth and employment.

The budget bears evenly on people and strives to share the burden fairly. Having stabilised the deficit this year, we have to take an important further step towards narrowing the large gap between what we, as a State, spend and what we take in. If we had taken no action, this gap would have grown again in 2011 from €18.7 billion to €22 billion. Our aim next year is to reduce the general government balance from 11.6% to 9.4% of GDP. As with paying a mortgage, the later steps will become progressively easier. With the budgets of the past two years, we were halfway along the path, with a €14.6 billion reduction since 2008. With this budget we are now two thirds of the way through the necessary adjustments.

Looking back, I doubt that any Government has acted so decisively and with such energy in a short period or done so much political heavy lifting.

It must be clearly understood that if we are to be in a position to borrow to maintain our public services, State pensions, unemployment benefits, schools and hospitals and pay those who work in them, we must adhere strictly to the agreed parameters of the national recovery plan we have drawn up and agreed with the European Union, ECB and IMF. The plan is the sole basis for drawing down the financial facility these bodies have made available to us. The front-loaded €6 billion cut in the deficit is the first and most crucial instalment.

There is no alternative option of €4.5 billion. If the Labour Party in government were to attempt to draw back from any aspect of the EU-IMF programme for financial support for Ireland without putting forward a full equivalent alternative, eurozone Finance Ministers would point out to it, in no uncertain terms, that it is bound by the scale of the commitments which underpin the agreement to provide support. If not, assistance would be suspended. Deputy Gilmore would do well to recognise his potential responsibilities and stop pretending to people in either a naive or deceitful way that his party has some other way.

[423]Despite the adjustments made to date, the economy is emerging from recession. There have been significant improvements in our competitiveness, as Ireland prices itself back into international markets. Our exports are performing strongly and have increased by 7% in the first half of the year. We are moving into a balance of payments surplus in 2011. Tax returns for 2010 are expected to be €450 million ahead of projections, while economic growth will also exceed forecasts. Unemployment has stabilised and the live register has fallen in each of the past three months.

When considering the challenges that lie ahead we need to remember how far we have come and the resilience shown by Irish people over the past two years. It is this resilience which gives confidence that we will emerge from this crisis quicker and more strongly than many commentators expect.

The national recovery plan published by the Government on 24 November is the basis for sustaining recovery. The plan outlines a pathway to restore the public finances by returning tax and expenditure levels to close to those of other European countries. Some €10 billion or two thirds of the budgetary adjustment will be achieved through reduced expenditure, with €3.9 billion of this figure being achieved in this budget. This means that by 2014 gross current expenditure will be back to 2007 levels.

Total Government voted expenditure as a percentage of GNP will be reduced from 49% to 36% by 2014. The remaining one third of the adjustment —€5 billion — will be achieved through taxation. The focus will be more on broadening the tax base than increasing tax rates, which is a more effective way of achieving revenue targets.

Tax receipts in 2010, nevertheless, will be 35% lower than in 2007, reflecting the over-dependence on property and construction-related revenue sources at that time.

A fundamental principle of the reform outlined in this plan is that all taxpayers must contribute according to their means. Those who can pay most will pay most, but no group can be entirely sheltered. The changes in the plan will bring the income tax structure back nearer to what existed in 2006. This budget is the first phase in this fundamental restructuring of the public finances, bringing them back to a sustainable position, while maximising the economy’s potential to grow and again create jobs.

  11 o’clock

We cannot afford delay. As of now, the parties opposite are not agreed on how much needs to be done or how it is to be done, as our previous exchanges amply illustrated. We do not have the luxury of time to allow all that to be worked out. Completion of the first steps towards the agreed target deficit of 3% of GDP by 2014 or, at the latest, 2015, will create the necessary breathing space, so that an election can be held and a new Government formed. We will not shirk our responsibility for the welfare of our people in the meantime. All sides of the House and people outside it need to be aware that restoring our country’s credibility, including re-building the confidence which is essential to recovery, depends on our being able to follow through swiftly on the commitments we have made.

The main task of the Government I have led has, from the outset, been to secure the best interests of the nation in the most challenging times. We have made hard choices and taken unpopular decisions in the interests of the security and well-being of our people. As a Government, we did our best to resolve both the banking and the deficit situations on our own. The interdependence of the modern world as well as our membership of the eurozone and large market movements have, in the end, put some of the solutions beyond our control.

Both the EU and the eurozone are themselves facing fundamental challenges in devising a fair and equitable response to a financial crisis situation, present and future, that may, in a [424]chain reaction, adversely affect several member countries. That our domestic measures did not prove sufficient does not mean they were not necessary. It was essential for us to make the maximum effort, which will now be supported by the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF. We are in a different territory from when such interventions were made in the past, for example, when Britain in 1969 and 1976 made application to the IMF at a time when we shared a common currency with it. For a small country, in particular, economic sovereignty has in practice always been somewhat circumscribed.

If we are to recover greater freedom of action in the future, as we all wish, it will not be done by a foolish and petulant unilateral repudiation of our obligations, for which there is no successful precedent anywhere, nor by a refusal to accept any share of responsibility for our collective actions in the boom years. Our situation will only be improved by following the route set out in the national recovery plan, of which the budget is the critical first instalment. Principally, what we must do to put our economy and our finances back on an even keel is to correct the overshoot wherever that occurred. A limited sacrifice in recent improvements in living standards will put us back on a path we can sustain. It is not about reverting to where we were ten or 20 years ago, rather, in most cases, to where we were only a few years ago.

I accept the argument that we have to start at the top. The Taoiseach’s salary is being reduced by a third compared to what it was in 2008, with net pay down 45%. The future salary for the President will be set at the new public sector ceiling of €250,000, which, when existing top level contracts in the semi-State bodies expire, will apply across the public sector, including to judges. I wish to acknowledge the President’s announcement that she will, on a voluntary basis, apply this new rate as she has accepted previous reductions. Ministers will have seen their net take-home pay reduced by 36%, while Deputies’ net salaries will have been reduced by a third.

Pension lump sums will be taxed above €200,000, and the public service pension will be reduced by an average of 4%. New entrants will enter at a 10% lower starting income. With the important exception of education, public sector numbers will fall back to lower levels by 2014, though much of the improvement in services will be broadly maintained. A more competitive economy has to reduce its overheads.

The cumulative impact of budgets since budget 2009 has been highly progressive, taking welfare and tax changes together. Changes in the pension regime are mainly focused on the highest earners. Twenty-four reliefs and exemptions are being terminated or restricted, including property reliefs. The cap on employees’ PRSI is being removed, as has long been advocated. In making the adjustments in this budget, we have protected the vulnerable as much as possible while continuing to incentivise work, jobs, and growth, on which their incomes depend.

Everybody pays something, but the better-off pay most. At present, the top 8% of earners pay 60% of tax. After this budget, the top income earners will continue to pay, proportionately, the most. Much criticized tax breaks which mainly benefit high earners will be largely eliminated. While it has been necessary to cut working age welfare payments, the 2011 rates will still be more than double the 1997 levels, compared to a consumer price index or price increase of 45%. Child benefit rates will be three times higher than in 1997.

To put all this in context, tax measures over the four years of the national recovery plan will bring us back to 2006 levels. After this budget, 38% of people will still be outside the tax net. The increase in numbers of people coming into the tax net at present is 45% and will be 38%. The new minimum wage level, designed to increase the availability of jobs, will not be in the tax net. The sum of €306 for a 40 hour week compares favourably with a single person’s job-[425]seeker’s benefit of €188. Despite the reduction, the minimum wage will still be considerably above the level in the UK and Northern Ireland.

In the debate, I cannot overlook the fact that the Labour Party is seriously at odds with Fine Gael as to the proportion of the adjustment that would be met from additional taxation. The Labour Party’s tax policy is closer to Sinn Féin’s than it is to Fine Gael’s. Fine Gael’s commitment is to confine tax measures to one-third of total cuts from 2011-2014. The Labour Party proposes that half of the adjustments will come from more taxes. It is worth pondering what the outcome of the Labour Party’s proposal of increased taxes might mean for average working families. If the party had its way on raising €2.5 billion in taxes as it proposed last week, and given that it voted against our proposals, this could, for example, involve a 2% increase on the standard rate of income tax, a 5% increase on the higher rate, or 1% on the lower rate and 3% on the higher rate in addition to a further 2% increase on the standard VAT rate to 25% with implications for competition across the Border, as well as a site value tax of €400, not the €200 average. In spite of claims that the target would be the well-off, experience shows that the average PAYE taxpayer has always fared worse when the Labour Party was in Government.

A priority for this Government is to protect the most vulnerable in our society, while ensuring that those of us who can afford to carry the heaviest burden do so. An additional €10 million has been provided for the disability sector. We have also prioritised the free pre-school education programme. We have not reduced the contributory old age pension in order that those in our elderly community who are unable to work to improve their incomes are protected. We have also increased funding by €8 million to allow for more home help packages in 2011. We have provided increased funding of €115 million for an additional 120,000 medical cards next year, and additional funding for the following key priority services: older people —€ 14 million; the fair deal — another €6 million; cancer —€8 million; child protection, as per the Ryan report recommendations —€9 million and suicide prevention —€1 million.

The reductions in many social welfare payments are a regrettable but necessary, part of this adjustment. Budget 2011 has to be seen in the context of the recently published National Recovery Plan 2011-2014. As the Department of Social Protection is the biggest spending Department, accounting for approximately 38% of total gross Government expenditure, it is not possible to stabilise and reduce our public spending without there being an impact on that Department’s budget. Failure to take action now in regard to the level of expenditure by the Department would mean that supports to pensioners, carers, people with disabilities and jobseekers, among others, would become increasingly unsustainable.

There was a common consensus to protect State pensions and we did that. However, that narrows the range of where we can make savings. Jobseekers have already borne a burden in terms of cuts, but the more areas are exempted the more are jobseekers put in the firing line for greater cuts. The unvarnished facts are that to avoid cuts in widows’ and widowers’ pensions, blind pensions and long-term invalidity, disability and carers’ payments, it would have been necessary to implement a far higher cut on the jobseekers’ payments.

“So what?” somebody says. One would be talking about a cut of approximately €11 per week on jobseekers’ payments instead of the proposed €8 per week, which would involve a €19 cut for a couple. Where else in the social welfare budget, over and above what we have done, would the Opposition make these cuts?

[426]The Government, in a hugely challenging budgetary environment, has done its utmost to protect the most vulnerable in our society in these circumstances. The adjustments we have made cannot be viewed in isolation and must also be seen in the context of the fact that over the past decade the Government has trebled the social welfare budget, whereas, over the same period, prices of goods and services have increased by less than a third. The total increase in social welfare expenditure has gone from €6.7 billion in 2000 to a total expenditure of €20.9 billion in 2010. In that time, the Government has significantly extended coverage, removed barriers and increased entitlements, such that the level and extent of social support payments has been transformed beyond recognition.

We have maintained the half-rate carer’s payment for those who have another social welfare payment and find themselves in a caring position. We have maintained all of the innovations that were introduced by the late Mr. Seamus Brennan when he was Minister for Social and Family Affairs. We changed the system fundamentally so that a person is only entitled to one payment from the system. We made carer’s allowance the highest rate of social welfare payment in the social welfare code because we recognised——

Rightly so. We did it, and I am proud of the things we did during those years.

I am proud of the fact that in regard to education in the disability sector we spent €1 billion of an €8 billion budget in mainstreaming people with disability into our education system. While some say I should be ashamed, I am proud of all of those progressive social policies. The situation, and what we need to say to the public, is this — despite the economic tsunami that hit this country a couple of years ago and from which we are still trying to recover, all those social gains did not go out with the sea. Many, if not all, can be retained and many can be regained and improved upon when things pick up again in the years ahead.

While that is a commitment we can all make, we have to be straight about it. In their analysis of yesterday’s budget, on the one hand, Fine Gael says there is no need for any income tax increases and, on the other, the Labour Party says there is no need for any welfare cuts.

That is simply an incredible position to take 12 hours after one of the most important budgets in the history of the State being brought into this House and, thankfully, passed as a result of the democratic process here last night.

The levels of income support provided by the State to those on welfare are still among the highest in Europe, of which we are all proud. People who live in Border counties know what the social welfare payments are across the Border. Many in the North used in the past to look towards the Republic and suggest patronisingly that we were not capable of looking after our own people. The social policies we introduced in recent years were the right thing to do. When else were we going to be able to do this? If we take the decisions now, we can maintain much, perhaps as much as 90%, of those gains. However, if we play the game the Opposition want to play — the game of “No, there is some other soft option available. No, we have a solution here that does not involve you or the next person being affected”— then the rate of cuts will become far greater and more unsustainable far more quickly, apart from the fact we need to ensure the programme we have agreed is implemented as quickly as possible.

[427]We need to provide an input of confidence and to let people see that the Government, the country and the Dáil, however hot and heavy our debates get, are prepared to take the decisions that are necessary for this country to come through. That is what people going to work or staying at home today want to hear from us.

Let us have our differences but let us not get into a stupid debate or descend into the foolishness of suggesting there is an alternative Government available to this country in the months ahead that will neither increase tax nor cut welfare during the course of the coming year. It is patent nonsense and it needs to be seen for what it is.

As Taoiseach, I am deeply conscious that the adjustments in social welfare expenditure in this budget will affect the living standards of many of our citizens in the short term. However, if we put off these changes, there will be a greater burden in the future on all those who can least bear it. What is most important now is that we can sustain a strong welfare system into the future. These adjustments mean we have cut back slightly but they protect people from the risk of more severe cuts in the future.

We are keeping those who have lost their jobs as close to the labour market as possible. We are providing 15,000 extra activation places at a cost of €200 million on a skills and internship programme, a work placement programme and a community work placement scheme which supplement the existing level of activity. Since this crisis began, we have doubled the number of training places from 66,000 to over 130,000. To this can be added the thousands of people on the back to education scheme as well as the private sector labour activation scheme introduced by the Tánaiste when she held that Department, which is a good scheme and one which can be expanded and be part of how we deal with this situation for people who want to stay active and up-skill. Under the Department of Social Protection, there are 55,000 more places for people on community employment schemes, the community support programme and the rural social scheme.

Taking all of that, there are 205,000 places, together with the 15,000 announced here. When one considers that 290,000 people in this country are signing on for unemployment full-time, five days a week, it gives an indication of the level of response we are trying to achieve in very straitened and difficult circumstances.

If the Deputy wants to be patronising about it, that is his problem. The facts are that these decisions were taken by Government at a time of great economic difficulty.

Everybody recognises we have to provide as much support as we can. I looked at some of the proposals from other parties in regard to this matter in their pre-budget submissions, and they are broadly in the same territory both in terms of scale and objective.

We are extending the employer job incentive scheme to the end of 2011 and transforming the business expansion scheme to incentivise firms to employ staff. We are undertaking a number of key strategic initiatives to create new jobs and get people back to work. The business expansion scheme and the new employment incentive announced by the Minister yesterday require state aid approval, which should be forthcoming in the normal time period in the coming months. The issue is we are making sure that, as we close down the tax shelters in [428]other areas, we provide an opportunity for people to invest in those entrepreneurs, businesses and enterprises that require assistance and funding at this time. We are increasing the amount one can invest in overall terms to €10 million, and €2.5 million annually, where the current limit is €1.5 million, and dealing with a complaint from business regarding some of these issues. People are out there creating jobs in terms of the certification process being more streamlined and user friendly. We want to broaden the areas of activity the business expansion scheme at present includes and the areas where investment can be made. That is a good initiative and it is the right thing to do. Those with investment income are being channelled into those areas of best employment effect in the public policy area.

At almost €35 billion, we are maintaining proportionately one of the largest capital investment programmes in Europe. We will spend €4.7 billion next year on the capital programme. When we consider the difficulties we have faced, to listen to some of the commentary and analysis from Members, which for some reason they think is a good idea, they suggest that due to the economic tsunami we have lost it all. Have we been knocking down the new hospitals? Are the new schools being closed? Have the extensions to all the basic infrastructure developments in our towns and villages throughout the country been closed up? The answer is “No”. They have added to our competitiveness, and the people driving around the country today know this. To spend billions of euro in these areas was the right thing to do.

In current circumstances, as we know, there is greater value for money to be had given the more competitive position, with tender prices down by approximately 30%. We are continuing to work in that area. With regard to the €4.7 billion, whether it is the €400 million for our health programme, the €383 million going into capital spending in our schools, the €500 million being invested in our water services programme or the €500 million being invested in our housing programme, including for regeneration in Ballymun and Limerick, which is much needed, as we saw again on recent programmes on RTE, these are important initiatives. The Government is seeking to address issues constructively and is prepared to invest in the country at a time of difficulty. That is what we are doing.

With regard to semi-State bodies, the amount of investment that will be undertaken by the utilities, telecommunications and broadband companies, including those in the private sector, will be of the order of €2 billion next year.

Total expenditure on capital programmes through commercial semi-State investment and the public investment programme will be €6.5 billion next year.

That should not be regarded as something just to be sniffed at. It is important work building on all the investments we have made in the past. Unprecedented capital investment has changed the face of and transformed this country, much for the better.

If the capacity was such, it happened in the private sector.

Taxpayers’ money was invested in schools in the Deputy’s constituency and he has been trying to take credit for this for the past ten years. Taxpayers’ money ensured [429]serious investments were made. Why can the Deputy not simply acknowledge that and move on to the debate about the future?

The Deputy’s problem is that he is not able to move on because he does not have a policy framework that stands up.

I do not know whether the finance spokesperson heard his leader this morning.

He suggested that Deputy Noonan would not have to raise any money in income tax to make a cut of €6 billion.

Is that true? Could that be true? I refer to the man who was supposed to have brought some gravitas to the finance spokesmanship in recent months and who was ensuring the leader could step back a bit that we might hear a bit of common sense.

In the past 25 minutes, there has been a need to get an editor for him.

He has really gone overboard this time.

Our five-year integrated plan for trade, tourism and investment will create 300,000 jobs and boost exports by one third. This is based on the figures of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and on the spillover effect that can happen. We must be conveying to the public and investor community that we seek investment income for productive areas of the economy, not only at home but also abroad. If we are to continue to talk about economic corpses and state the country is banjaxed, that we should forget about it and that it will all change when the Opposition gets into power, we will not be productive.

If Deputy Gilmore is the good guy, we must be in bigger trouble than I believed we were in. Certainly, working people will know how the Labour Party dealt with PAYE taxpayers when it was in Government. This is because that party will not take the decisions to cut back on the services when those decisions are necessary. It piled the tax on working people. When Deputy Gilmore asks me to wait until the Labour Party is back in power, he should note that [430]when he was in Government, he taxed people who earned above €7,000. He started taxing people earning €120 per week.

We made changes yesterday.

One will have to earn €16,300 before one starts contributing to the tax system. This is because we wanted to ensure people on low incomes are helped, avoid poverty traps and maintain the incentive to work. Even after yesterday’s budget, in respect of which every superlative one could think of has been used in an effort to say how terrible it is——

Yet, 38% of people going to work today will not be in the tax net after this budget.

That is our commitment to these people. I will discuss that with the Deputy any time.

The Deputy does not have to engage in defence. The wry smile of the finance spokesperson said it all for me.

We have set up an innovation fund of €500 million that will support enterprise development and job creation by drawing top venture capitalists to Ireland. It is interesting that the first tranche has attracted 23 expressions of interest. That is the way we can get capital into high-technology companies that are presently short of resources and which find it hard to bank their projects because of the nature of the activity in which they are engaged. The research element must be borne in mind.

A €32 million labour market activation fund is targeted at specific priority groups among the unemployed, and is supporting almost 60 projects and 11,000 participants this year. This is an important point to make. The fund represents a good initiative that marries public policy objectives to private sector initiatives.

Under the four year plan, we will use moneys from the national pensions reserve fund for projects such as the water metering programme and retrofitting. Our low corporation tax rate of 12.5% is the cornerstone of our economic policy. Foreign direct investment supports 240,000 jobs in this country.

Both AIB and the Bank of Ireland are to make €12 billion available to SMEs over the next two years. We have remained true to our ambition to make Ireland a global innovation hub, a [431]country that can support high-value jobs based on innovation and knowledge. It is something to be said for our country that, at a time of such difficulty, it was first in the foreign direct investment stakes per head of population last year. Last year was one of the most difficult years we have ever had. We were so successful because, despite the difficulty and contraction of the economy, we continued to create an environment here that promotes enterprise and jobs and, importantly, looks to our own resources.

The tourism sector, for example, will benefit from a programme worth over €200 million. If one considers the change to the travel tax, which will cost the taxpayer approximately €65 million——

That is one aspect. With regard to promoting the tourism product in Ireland, the sum in question amounts to over €100 million. There is expenditure of over €40 million on tourism marketing. In this area, a serious, focused effort is being made to increase tourist numbers.

With regard to agriculture, in respect of which I will be glad to hear from Deputy Stanton, we have a strategy in place and confidence has returned to the sector. I recall meeting worried representatives of the agri-food business at the height of this crisis, at which time it was suggested that up to 40% of its base would disappear because of factors exacerbated by the exchange rate problem. This is because many of our goods and services in this area go into the sterling area, as the Deputies know. All of them have come through and all have growth strategies. I am thankful that primary producers such as farmers have had a much better year this year than in the preceding two. There is now leadership. I acknowledge the leadership in the farming community and agri-food sector. People in the sector are getting on with their work and saying we must move on and increase our output and job content. These are our own natural resources.

There will be considerable investment next year in the forestry sector. Shouting at me will not change this. Deputy Barrett should give me a shout when he is to make his contribution and I will come down and listen respectfully to what he has to say. He cannot make his contribution at the same time as I am making mine.

That is just not the way it works.

The Government is investing over €570 million in science, technology and innovation next year. We are continuing with that. When one considers the budgets for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, one will note the total budget for enterprise support next year is €508 million. It will rise by €50 million in 2012 and 2013 because that is the commitment we are making in terms of focusing on the promotion of growth and job creation.

[432]When people talk about the need to put jobs and growth at the centre of our economic agenda, we agree with them, but one cannot just ask where the stimulus is. The stimulus is that our competitiveness is improving and that we are investing €6.5 billion next year through commercial semi-State companies and our public investment programme. By any rule of thumb, that amounts to the maintenance of over 65,000 jobs.

If one considers the activation area, what is occurring under the business expansion scheme, the supports from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, the areas of science, technology and innovation and the work of Science Foundation Ireland one will realise we have a real economy that is forging ahead if we give it the chance. Exports have increased by 6% and merchandising exports have increased by 12% in the past three months. We will have a balance of payments surplus next year. While we must do our job in this House, namely, fixing the public finances, we must also ensure that enterprising, entrepreneurial businessmen and businesswomen, both at home and abroad, are supported in every way, including economically, diplomatically and by way of marketing. All the State agencies must be motivated to support Ireland in selling its goods and services globally such that there will be demand for them when we set the right price. This is what we have been able to do as a result of the policies we have been implementing. That changeover has happened.

Science Foundation Ireland will be maintaining 29 top-class research centres in 2011 and it continues to work with over 400 industry partners. This is important if we are to sustain growth. It is in this area that we must invest now if we are to secure the new jobs and services of the future.

Enterprise Ireland will help approximately 1,200 companies with research and innovation activities in 2011. It will also support 85 high-potential start-up companies next year, rising to 100 by 2015. I refer to scale-up companies in addition to start-up companies, as mentioned by Deputy Gilmore a few days ago. The number of industry-led competency centres will be doubled to 16 by 2015. Innovation Fund Ireland will grow to €500 million, attracting leading international venture capital companies to Ireland; and the IDA will continue to attract new investments, nearly half of which were research and development related this year.

Ireland is developing a strong international reputation for innovation and high tech start-ups. The smart economy can be an important part of our economic recovery, and the budget positions us to take advantage.

We are introducing incentives to bring confidence to the housing market, including a reduced flat rate 1% stamp duty rate on residential property transactions up to €l million; an improved tenant purchase scheme available now to 45,000 more tenants in this country who can obtain the ownership of their home based on a much improved and far more attractive scheme brought forward by the Minister for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran; measures to help registered tax compliant contractors; and tax incentives for retrofitting home energy efficiency measures are a way of ensuring that we reduce the black economy and make sure those who are compliant and are running their businesses properly, ethically and in a business like fashion are supported. By reducing the relevant contracts tax from 35% to 20% we greatly improve the cash flow of those businesses that are compliant and ensure we are able to deal with those who are trying to play it both ways using the system.

We are supporting tourism by reducing the air travel tax to €3, and the DAA will be incentivising carriers to bring in additional airline passengers.

I have made the point about the capital investment programme. It is critical. While difficult decisions have been made in this budget, and further challenging measures will be put in place over the lifetime of the four year plan, we have retained the vast majority of the benefits of the boom.

The tax measures over the four years of the national recovery plan will bring us to 2006 levels. Spending levels will be brought to 2007-08 levels. However, spending on the productive capacity of the economy will continue apace.

During the good times, we used the fruits of the boom not only to reduce our national debt to very low levels but we also invested wisely in the productive capacity of the economy — in schools, roads, public transport, communications, research and innovation, and housing. We retain this infrastructure, and that is helping to grow the economy once again. Anyone visiting this country now would see how much better served we are by that infrastructure compared to the 1980s.

We had one of the highest rates of public investment in Europe over the past ten years and we still have that now.

We retain a high level of capital investment by international and historical standards — nearly €16.5 billion in the period up to 2014. That will be invested in projects which support economic growth and employment.

Next year alone we will invest €4.7 billion. This will allow several new road projects to start, support major regeneration projects in Ballymun and Limerick, sustain the school building programme, and progress high priority health projects, particularly in the mental health area.

There is a major allocation for the new national energy retrofit programme. This will combine existing domestic energy efficiency initiatives, supporting jobs for former construction workers and making sure that the tax credit is available as well as the direct grant-in-aid through the various schemes. The tax credit scheme will be of wider application and bring in more types of remedial and improvement works, which I believe is necessary as people look now to improve their own housing situation rather than buying up. This programme will be complemented by a new tax credit for domestic energy efficiency improvements.

Most important, we have prioritised spending on enterprise supports. At a time of major crisis, it is appropriate to draw on all our resources.

We will continue to bring forward public private partnerships in transport, education and health. We will help to identify public investment opportunities for the National Pensions Reserve Fund and other private investors, and we will support major investments by our commercial semi-State companies — more than €2 billion in the energy sector alone in 2011.

The Government remains convinced that North-South co-operation is a central element in the push for economic recovery. Budget 2011 has maintained overall funding levels for North-South co-operation, with a total allocation of over €110 million.

The increased allocation of €14 million for cross-Border transport initiatives will help promote jobs and economic recovery in Border communities and the wider economy. This includes the necessary funding to meet the Irish Government’s commitment to the joint projects to upgrade the cross-Border road network, and we stand by those decisions.

[434]The budget also includes funding of almost €80 million for the North-South bodies. Of course, like all other public sector bodies they will see reduced budgets, but this substantial funding will enable those bodies to continue their essential work.

The future prosperity of the island economy is essential to building on the peace we have achieved and to creating economic opportunities for a new generation that can enjoy that peace. We will not let our economic difficulties distract us from that core mission of this Government.

As well as the work of the North-South bodies, areas of co-operation such as health and education, and joint investment projects, there is an increasing range of shared economic concerns between North and South in areas such as banking, energy and research development. I look forward to discussing these issues with colleagues from the Northern Ireland Executive at the British-Irish Council meeting next week and at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council, which I expect to be held shortly.

Our economy retains very significant strengths. We have the youngest population in Europe, with one in three under 25; we have the highest proportion of graduates among the 25 to 34 age group in the European Union; our exports are performing strongly; we are the ninth best country worldwide in which to do business according to the World Bank; Ireland’s stock of direct inward investment is five times greater than the OECD average; our competitiveness has significantly improved; we have clusters of the world’s leading multinational companies, and continue to attract high levels of investment. Almost 1,000 companies, including household names such as IBM, Google, eBay and Facebook, have chosen Ireland as the hub of their European operations.

A fair and effective budget will boost confidence and jobs. We need to start believing in ourselves again, particularly in the public arena and to communicate that with confidence to the outside world. I commend the budget to the House.
