I might not take the 30 minutes. I am delighted to speak on the budget, which was very realistic, well thought-out and planned for the crisis in this country——

——inherited from the western world and, one could say, the events of Wall Street. We could have had a Wall Street crash of 1930s proportion coming along the line. I was shocked listening to the comments of Deputy Kehoe as we have served this country well for the past ten years and I have no doubt we will serve it for another ten or 15 years with the way it is going.

We have done well in the education sector. I cannot understand teachers going to meetings now who were around and did well from the Celtic tiger. The debate surrounding the education cuts in the budget is an exaggeration. The Fine Gael spokesperson was not overly enthusiastic about the wages or salaries of teachers. The party’s finance spokesperson talked about adjusting to a €4 billion cutback but we only brought about a €2 billion cutback. The party has left unanswered how it would find this €4 billion in cuts. Would it close down the whole public and Civil Service?

There is no point in the Opposition making those kinds of charges.

If it wants to be realistic and productive——

The Opposition was asleep on the medical card issue. It was announced in the budget and the Opposition did not know about it.

Fianna Fáil had to educate the Opposition on it, and we put the matter right. One had to admit there was no increase in the medical card scale from 2006 until after the budget.

At that stage, the medical card scale was under the €223, which was the maximum pension being paid. We put the matter right. I could consider the whole well-structured budget. I know much about agriculture.

I made comments in Cork the other night. I do not run away; I will not do that for anyone.


Agriculture has suffered a minimum of cutbacks and we have been really generous in that area. It has been really well served by Fianna Fáil in Government for many years.

Between 1994 and 1997, when the Opposition parties were in Government there were cutbacks. Installation aid, retirement benefits, farm grants and many other schemes were disbanded. The Deputies’ memories are very short. There were also 12,000 applications in-house that were not processed and farmers were left without as a result. We have not acted in such a way; we have suspended a scheme until the economy improves and we will look after those people on another day.

It is important the Deputies know a bit of the truth. The Opposition often does not know about it. This budget was good and many areas were looked after. I will make a few specific points regarding roads in my own area, where we have done very well in the development of such roads.

We have the N73 and N72, taking in Mallow to Fermoy and Mallow to Rosslare, as well as Mitchelstown to Mallow and on to Rathmore, which is the constituency of the Ceann Comhairle. These require upgrading and I appeal to the Minister for Transport, through the Department of Finance, for extra funding for those two routes. They carry significant volumes of traffic, especially during the summer months because of the tourist business from Rosslare to Killarney. They are vital to the area’s infrastructure. I do not know the exact cost of the funding but not much would be needed to allow the upgrade. I appeal for them to be looked after. The entire problem has been brought about by globalisation in the world economy. We were mad on it and globalisation was everything. Everyone learned the globe when attending school and everyone knows where are the other parts of the world.

However, I know about globalisation in respect of agriculture best and I wish to refer to this subject this evening. We destroyed our agriculture industry in the past ten years because of globalisation. We lost many of our jobs and have displaced many farmers.

On globalisation, we lost——

We had cheap imports from the Pacific and south Atlantic regions, which competed successfully against Irish farmers. I have seen this. The same thing happened in my own locality, where we had a wonderful organisation called Dairygold. It used to turn over €1 billion per annum, killed 500,000 pigs and 100,000 cattle, as well as processing approximately 200 million gallons of milk into substantial and good brands. All now is gone. A chief executive came in there four or five years ago who diversified into the construction industry. [140] Although he was going to build empires in the towns and villages, all that remains to us is rubble. We have loads of rubble in Mallow and Mitchelstown. The reason I mentioned the N72 and N73 is because the rubble would be ideal to rebuild those roads.

The fine brands that were developed in that area, such as Galtee cheese, Mitchelstown bacon, Galtee bacon and Calvita cheese all are gone and are being sold off——

However, the Competition Authority objects to this. Moreover, 1,500 jobs were lost and I blame Enterprise Ireland for much of what happened as it went along with the flow because it constituted globalisation.

I also am highly critical of Kerry Foods, which is a major importer and which does not kill a single animal in this country. It only is a secondary processor that imports, thereby destroying Irish agriculture and the Irish farming scene. I have stated this previously and few jobs will be created in this manner. Although agriculture has greatly suffered in this regard, the Fine Gael Members tonight are discussing matters that are peripheral to agriculture, such as installation aid.

I am discussing the real economics of agriculture where the bread and butter of the industry——


I make the point that I wish to see——


Members should consider what happened in Iceland.


Iceland went down the road of——


Iceland neglected its fishing industry and went down the path of financial services. Where is it today? The same thing has happened. We neglected our agriculture in a manner that was promoted by everyone. I spoke at meetings throughout the country and was laughed out of school in many places at public meetings——-

——because I was told that agriculture was yesterday’s business.

I raised this issue with Dan McLaughlin of Bank of Ireland. I had known, and can quote several paper cuttings from the past four or five years to this effect, where we were going in the world economy in respect of construction but no one took it seriously. That is the reason we have finished up on the rocks today. The results published by AIB this morning are quite frightening when compared with those from six months ago. I consider them to be quite alarming.

In the course of another debate in this House a few weeks ago, I stated that many people have invested heavily in the Irish stock market and other stock markets. Rather than investing in pension funds, they invested in the shares of Irish banks. They will receive no dividend. Such people will have paper shares and I do not know when they will grow again, expand and pay out dividends. I noted the bank today referred to 2011 and possibly later. Such people now are paupers because the small amount of capital they possess precludes them from qualifying for a non-contributory old age pension. Many such people have contacted me and I am quite concerned by this issue. I acknowledge the banks and all businesses must improve their capital base. The only way they can do that is by not paying a dividend, rather than engaging in scrip issues and whatever goes with so doing.

In respect of interest rates, I made a point in the House some weeks ago about the manner in which we had behaved. Developers bought land from farmers at crossroads and paid small money for it. They then developed such land by putting water or sewage pipes into it thereby increasing its value three, four or fivefold. Moreover, they got away with 20% capital gains tax. Had that tax been set at a higher level, we may not have had the problems we face today in respect of developers. As I have suggested previously, we should have a much higher rate of tax for speculators than for the ordinary Joe Soap. Although the man on the street expects an increase of 2% or 3% in his wage packet, share options was the name of the game for these people. I invest heavily and make no secret of it. I have suffered a lot in recent weeks and [142]make no apology for that either. Members will see that my returns for next year will not be better than those for last year. I can live with that.

They will not be embarrassing for me.

I grew up in a house in which finance was discussed and this economy used to have high interest rates to discipline the economy. During the past ten or 12 years, although Japan has set both low and zero interest rates, it still has not emerged from its difficulties. The only way in which one can discipline an economy is to have higher levels of interest. Low interest rates and zero interest rates were set in America four or five years ago and further back but it has not done them any good. If one wishes to stop spending, one must make it expensive to spend and we should have done that. I remember the 1950s and 1960s when de Valera and Seán Lemass were in power. They used to operate credit squeezes and would increase interest rates. The Central Bank then had much greater authority and control than is the case at present. While one criticises the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, this might not be justified because of the Single Market and of events in Europe, which governed them to an extent. Perhaps we are taking a wrong direction. Although we have been boastful about reducing interest rates, it appears the financial institutions are not able to lower such interest rates as they should.


I wish to refer to that issue in this debate. I remind Deputy Stanton that when he attends meetings and invites me to support his party, as he did the other night, I also would welcome him to this side of the House to support Fianna Fáil in the good decisions we take. He would be more than welcome on this side of the House.

I had a lost opportunity the other night because Deputy Stanton spoke after me but I would have welcomed him warmly on this side because our decisions are always much better than those of Fine Gael.

I came into the House this evening to develop a point I made previously. I made a statement in the House in respect of the state of auditing. To back up my statement, I can cite two major companies, namely, Enron in America, which was a huge company, and Parmalat in Italy. They went to the wall during the good times but had they been properly audited in either country, they would not have experienced difficulties. There is [143]a need for a tightening of auditing and the structure of appointing auditors to limited liability companies must be changed in the Oireachtas. There must be greater input into the selection of auditors. Perhaps there should be a selection process, similar to that which has been put in place by the Minister for directors of banks. The latter has not been announced yet but he is about to do it. I envisage a system in which there would be a panel of auditors from which they could be selected. This would be the way to do it because we are losing out heavily in this regard. I believe the banking problems in respect of the liabilities that have arisen and their foreign borrowings to fund the Irish market and perhaps other markets abroad, should have been seen by auditors. Such matters should have been raised and such activities should have been brought to heel. However, this was not done and that is where we are today.

On the Lisbon treaty, it is highly embarrassing for Ireland that it has not ratified the treaty. We must work hard to get back into the mainstream of Europe, to become the model of Europe again and to become the favoured people in Europe. We must get all sectors of society to support us. I refer in particular to the farming community, which has most to lose in a scenario in which we are not in Europe. I believe this must be done quickly. I have campaigned for Europe more extensively than most because I campaigned for it initially in 1972. It was obvious to me that those who opposed our accession in 1972 were still around and at some stage would get a victory, which they did in the referendum.

I do not worry about victories but what happened was a tragedy and it should not have happened. I heard Cardinal Brady speak at today’s meeting of the Sub-committee on Ireland’s Future in the European Union. He spoke about Europe and referred to Tory Island among other things. In principle, he was in favour of supporting the Lisbon treaty.

Much has been said about school buildings in tonight’s debate. I understand that next year we will build 62 major school building projects and that we will build 100 school extensions. In addition, small school work schemes will go ahead as well as devolved grants. Many questions have been asked about Church of Ireland schools. I have sympathy for the Church of Ireland as the minority religion. Those schools qualify for a block grant of €3.8 million. I have two minority schools in my area and I was concerned about them because they raised the issue with me. I am grateful to the Minister for Education and Science for being helpful in that regard.

It is difficult to debate an issue when things have been so favourable previously. We had many good years. However, all budgets are difficult. We had a budget in 1997 that caused difficulties. Every budget in recent years had its problems because it did not meet the requirements of every citizen. People are fond of lobbying and creating a fuss about issues.

I am impressed by the support of the Green Party, under the leadership of Deputy Gormley, for the Government. He realises the importance of the economy and has put the national interest at the top of his agenda in supporting the budget. That kind of commitment from a minority party is a sure sign of the importance of the issue at stake.

We have to borrow €11.5 billion this year and we will borrow €13.5 billion in 2009 to keep public services afloat. In 2009 alone that is equivalent to borrowing an extra €37 million every day of the year. That is an indication of how serious is the matter. We have gone from a position of substantial growth in the economy to not having any growth. By 2011 that will mean additional borrowing of €45 billion. That is an enormous sum on which to pay interest. It is equivalent to approximately €10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country or more than €21,000 for every worker. Ten per cent of day-to-day spending will be borrowed in 2009. We must recognise that the figures are serious and accept the situation. I hope the Opposition recognises that. In fairness, the Opposition has been reasonably supportive but it has not answered my question on where it would make savings of €4 billion as opposed to the Government’s €2 billion.

[144]Much industry has come into this country in recent years, including from North America. Today is an historic day in the United States with the election of Barack Obama. I hope his commitment to this side of the Atlantic will be equal to that of previous US Presidents and that we can continue to have 100,000 jobs provided by North American industry in Ireland. However, we must also praise our own company, Cement Roadstone, which employs 100,000 people across the world. We have good businesses in this country and Cement Roadstone is one of our flagship industries. It deserves praise for its commitment. In recent days that company suffered substantially in the financial markets but for a multinational Irish company it employs a significant number of people. We greatly admire the company and its managers who have brought such success to the organisation, with the island of Ireland acting as a flagship for us in all regions and continents around the world.

I also praise the American companies that are located in Ireland. I hope they can all stay with us in spite of what has been said. Dell is the one I am most concerned about because it generates significant employment in my area of Cork on the Limerick border. I hear a lot about the company. I believe Dell is committed to Ireland and I hope it can continue here. The convoy of cars going from my area to Limerick city is reminiscent of the Munster final. Dell is a major employer that has taken up the slack due to the loss of the food industry in my area.

The food industry is one thing that is near and dear to me. Country of origin labelling must be addressed in an Irish context because of the huge amount of food imports that is taking from the livelihoods of farmers. It is a major issue. I serve on two committees of the House, namely, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Deputy Willie Penrose is Chairman of the former and Deputy Johnny Brady is Chairman of the latter. They have done great work in the area of country of origin labelling but we are not making the kind of progress I would like. If we do not make more progress we will have more imports. Country of origin labelling is necessary to give choice to housewives. It is important to know where a product comes from and to offer choice. If we do not have that we will never have the wholesome Irish food we were used to in the past, such as the traditional Irish breakfast.

I am conscious of what is happening in the country in this regard. We do not have any poultry processing such as we had in the past and there is no pig processing into a branded product. We only have primary production. There is no packaging or branding such as we had in the past and we are losing out heavily because of that. Fifteen years ago or more when we were in Opposition I went on a trip to Chicago. I was advised to take a case of Jameson whiskey and a case of Baileys with me for promotions there. It was a St. Patrick’s Day event. Jameson was not attractive at that time. Baileys was the in thing, and it still is. It is one of the brand leaders in the country. Jameson has been an outstanding success in the intervening 15 years. It is now a brand leader that challenges the major Scottish whisky brands, which have been very successful across the world. Jameson has been an enormous success under Irish Distillers and is an employer in my constituency, which I share with Deputy Stanton. The company continues to expand.

We should not dismiss brands and say they are out of date. We should promote them and develop them more. That is why I refer so much to the food industry and what has happened in north Cork. I am very passionate about what is happening there. I am sick of it. I cannot believe what has gone on there given the great success that emerged out of the developments from the 1930s. There is no need for it. My argument is that it was based on development and building. We were going to build apartments and hotels. We have built nothing only for all those places that are rubble. I gave the example of Jameson. Galtee cheese is gone; it is made [145]abroad. Shaws ham is packed in Scotland. It came out of Mitchelstown. No one knows where Calvita cheese comes from but if one looks at the bottom of the box it contains a little symbol and it states it was packed in England. I do not know why we had to do this or why farmers in my area supported that kind of executive. I call him Jerry Rubble now because that is what he is. He is rubble. I give the comparison between Jameson and why we lost our food industry.

I have it said now anyway. It is on the record. Country of origin labelling would do a lot for this country. There is resistance in Europe to it. What is happening is that all the foodstuff that I give out about are coming in through Rotterdam where some adjustment is made and it is sold across Europe. What is happening is that chicken and beef come into Ireland with breadcrumbs or some such additive and until we correct that system we will have no success with Irish food.

Ireland is one of the most successful countries for the production of food in the world because we are surrounded by water. It is a safe country. I refer to the island of Ireland, North and South. We have the ability to produce good food. The farming community has lost heavily because it has failed to develop and protect its co-operatives. We are seeing a downturn in agricultural prices and over-production in the milk industry in some parts of the world. Milk is being produced in substantial quantities in America and New Zealand and much of that is coming into Europe in spite of the tariff barriers. In the past, co-operatives were very vigilant, did great marketing for farmers and took their produce, but we have lost them. The recession will inspire people to protect their businesses rather than enjoy the buoyancy that existed heretofore.

My constituency has done very well under Administrations over the past ten or 15 years. There have been substantial new school developments and roads, and a new road is being built from Cork to Dublin. There are many industrial developments in Fermoy and such places. That town has done reasonably well and the new cattle mart has been grant aided by the Government. It has been the flagship sales area.

I want to praise a few projects in my part of the country of which I am very proud. I am very proud to have obtained Government support for them and hope I will continue to do so. I hope that, in spite of the decline in prosperity and the difficulties that exist, we will still be able to grant aid and support deserving and necessary projects. I have no doubt but that we will do so under the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The budget of the Minister for Finance was a Houdini job and was done very well. It has been acclaimed and the people realise it had to be structured in the way it was. Three major issues arose in respect of it but, ultimately, we have survived very well. Not alone that, people accept the budget and believe what we did was right. They are prepared to stay with us and support us in every way.

We have to borrow €11.5 billion this year and we will borrow €13.5 billion in 2009 to keep public services afloat. In 2009 alone that is equivalent to borrowing an extra €37 million every day of the year. That is an indication of how serious is the matter. We have gone from a position of substantial growth in the economy to not having any growth. By 2011 that will mean additional borrowing of €45 billion. That is an enormous sum on which to pay interest. It is equivalent to approximately €10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country or more than €21,000 for every worker. Ten per cent of day-to-day spending will be borrowed in 2009. We must recognise that the figures are serious and accept the situation. I hope the Opposition recognises that. In fairness, the Opposition has been reasonably supportive but it has not answered my question on where it would make savings of €4 billion as opposed to the Government’s €2 billion.

[144]Much industry has come into this country in recent years, including from North America. Today is an historic day in the United States with the election of Barack Obama. I hope his commitment to this side of the Atlantic will be equal to that of previous US Presidents and that we can continue to have 100,000 jobs provided by North American industry in Ireland. However, we must also praise our own company, Cement Roadstone, which employs 100,000 people across the world. We have good businesses in this country and Cement Roadstone is one of our flagship industries. It deserves praise for its commitment. In recent days that company suffered substantially in the financial markets but for a multinational Irish company it employs a significant number of people. We greatly admire the company and its managers who have brought such success to the organisation, with the island of Ireland acting as a flagship for us in all regions and continents around the world.

I also praise the American companies that are located in Ireland. I hope they can all stay with us in spite of what has been said. Dell is the one I am most concerned about because it generates significant employment in my area of Cork on the Limerick border. I hear a lot about the company. I believe Dell is committed to Ireland and I hope it can continue here. The convoy of cars going from my area to Limerick city is reminiscent of the Munster final. Dell is a major employer that has taken up the slack due to the loss of the food industry in my area.

The food industry is one thing that is near and dear to me. Country of origin labelling must be addressed in an Irish context because of the huge amount of food imports that is taking from the livelihoods of farmers. It is a major issue. I serve on two committees of the House, namely, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Deputy Willie Penrose is Chairman of the former and Deputy Johnny Brady is Chairman of the latter. They have done great work in the area of country of origin labelling but we are not making the kind of progress I would like. If we do not make more progress we will have more imports. Country of origin labelling is necessary to give choice to housewives. It is important to know where a product comes from and to offer choice. If we do not have that we will never have the wholesome Irish food we were used to in the past, such as the traditional Irish breakfast.

I am conscious of what is happening in the country in this regard. We do not have any poultry processing such as we had in the past and there is no pig processing into a branded product. We only have primary production. There is no packaging or branding such as we had in the past and we are losing out heavily because of that. Fifteen years ago or more when we were in Opposition I went on a trip to Chicago. I was advised to take a case of Jameson whiskey and a case of Baileys with me for promotions there. It was a St. Patrick’s Day event. Jameson was not attractive at that time. Baileys was the in thing, and it still is. It is one of the brand leaders in the country. Jameson has been an outstanding success in the intervening 15 years. It is now a brand leader that challenges the major Scottish whisky brands, which have been very successful across the world. Jameson has been an enormous success under Irish Distillers and is an employer in my constituency, which I share with Deputy Stanton. The company continues to expand.

We should not dismiss brands and say they are out of date. We should promote them and develop them more. That is why I refer so much to the food industry and what has happened in north Cork. I am very passionate about what is happening there. I am sick of it. I cannot believe what has gone on there given the great success that emerged out of the developments from the 1930s. There is no need for it. My argument is that it was based on development and building. We were going to build apartments and hotels. We have built nothing only for all those places that are rubble. I gave the example of Jameson. Galtee cheese is gone; it is made [145]abroad. Shaws ham is packed in Scotland. It came out of Mitchelstown. No one knows where Calvita cheese comes from but if one looks at the bottom of the box it contains a little symbol and it states it was packed in England. I do not know why we had to do this or why farmers in my area supported that kind of executive. I call him Jerry Rubble now because that is what he is. He is rubble. I give the comparison between Jameson and why we lost our food industry.

I have it said now anyway. It is on the record. Country of origin labelling would do a lot for this country. There is resistance in Europe to it. What is happening is that all the foodstuff that I give out about are coming in through Rotterdam where some adjustment is made and it is sold across Europe. What is happening is that chicken and beef come into Ireland with breadcrumbs or some such additive and until we correct that system we will have no success with Irish food.

Ireland is one of the most successful countries for the production of food in the world because we are surrounded by water. It is a safe country. I refer to the island of Ireland, North and South. We have the ability to produce good food. The farming community has lost heavily because it has failed to develop and protect its co-operatives. We are seeing a downturn in agricultural prices and over-production in the milk industry in some parts of the world. Milk is being produced in substantial quantities in America and New Zealand and much of that is coming into Europe in spite of the tariff barriers. In the past, co-operatives were very vigilant, did great marketing for farmers and took their produce, but we have lost them. The recession will inspire people to protect their businesses rather than enjoy the buoyancy that existed heretofore.

My constituency has done very well under Administrations over the past ten or 15 years. There have been substantial new school developments and roads, and a new road is being built from Cork to Dublin. There are many industrial developments in Fermoy and such places. That town has done reasonably well and the new cattle mart has been grant aided by the Government. It has been the flagship sales area.

I want to praise a few projects in my part of the country of which I am very proud. I am very proud to have obtained Government support for them and hope I will continue to do so. I hope that, in spite of the decline in prosperity and the difficulties that exist, we will still be able to grant aid and support deserving and necessary projects. I have no doubt but that we will do so under the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The budget of the Minister for Finance was a Houdini job and was done very well. It has been acclaimed and the people realise it had to be structured in the way it was. Three major issues arose in respect of it but, ultimately, we have survived very well. Not alone that, people accept the budget and believe what we did was right. They are prepared to stay with us and support us in every way.
