In the past ten years we reduced the national debt, which was extraordinarily high after the 1983-87 coalition of Fine Gael and Labour. We dramatically reduced that until we had the lowest debt to GDP ratio among Europe 15, other than Luxembourg. We went further. We put a huge amount of money into the pension reserve fund, putting money aside for the future because we were aware that the rate at which money was coming into the Exchequer could not continue indefinitely. We put money aside for the rainy day. We spent money on improving services. In every school in the country one can find a large number of staff who would not have been there five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago. I remember when a three-teacher school was literally a three-teacher school. There was no support or ancillary staff. That has all changed dramatically.

We are involved in the greatest ever investment in infrastructure in this country. When we came to power €320 million was being spent on national roads. The budget for 2009 is €1.9 billion. We were spending something paltry like €12 million on railways, but now we are making major investment in light and heavy rail throughout the country. We have provided our citizens with one of the best social welfare systems and pension rates anywhere in the developed world. Anybody who is used to dealing with people from other jurisdictions, when he or she examines what people get, realises how good our social welfare system is. That is where the money was spent and if that is what the Opposition Members consider wasting money, let them stand on their record. We were right to invest the money in these different ways and it was prudent.

I also recognise this budget was difficult for people. In the past ten years we have had the luxury of unprecedented economic growth. Year after year on budget day we could give more and more and were always able to give more than we took away. However, no matter how high the mountain, people want to go one step higher. It is a human desire. Therefore, I fully accept it was a shock to people this year that in the difficult budget we had to announce yesterday we had to ask the taxpayer for more than we could give. That was necessary to protect into the long-term, distant future the quality of the services we have developed and, particularly, to protect the vulnerable.

It is amazing that for the Labour Party the vulnerable are not the 70% of people over 70 who need the medical card, it is the 6% with the high incomes.

That is what worries the Labour Party because that is where the Labour vote comes from. However, we will park that.

The Deputy is trying to create a fear factor.

Virtually all reputable economists agree it was necessary for us to take the steps we took to consolidate the gains we have made and to make sure they last into the future. However, when one examines all the decisions made collectively, it is clear there were a number of basic aims. The first was to protect those on social welfare, with a €500 million package. The second was to protect those on lower incomes by putting a greater proportion of the burden on those with higher incomes while at the same time not creating a disincentive for employment and development. The third aim was to continue with the vast majority of the investment outlined in the national development plan, including in schools and our road and rail networks.

There are those who believe all our problems can be solved by reductions in cost of the public service. Indeed, the Government has built in significant savings in the cost of the public service for next year. However, it is insulting and grossly inaccurate for people to infer that most public service workers are either unproductive or underemployed. Having worked with public servants for many years I wish to state that my experience has been that many of them go way beyond the call of duty. Any time I have asked public servants to attend meetings at night, they have done so without question and with no additional remuneration. Of course there are people in the public service who do not deliver but that is true in all situations where thousands are employed. There will always be a few who are not pulling their weight. However, I have met many public servants who go way beyond the call of duty and who more than make up for those who might be less than productive.

[847]The Government is making radical changes and I have announced a number in my own Department. There is no question that all of us can create efficiencies. In the past three years I have set about amalgamating the Leader and partnership companies. It was a slow process and I thank some Opposition Deputies for their enormous support in this regard. The amalgamation was necessary because there was duplication of effort between the two organisations. Likewise, I amalgamated Bord na Gaeilge with Foras na Gaeilge because there was no need for a free-standing board in that case.

I have no doubt that in the coming months, however, as decisions are made by the Government and put into action in the wider public service, despite present calls for even more radical action, we will be inundated with representations from Opposition Deputies to preserve the jobs and conditions of employment of those in the public service. I hope I am wrong and that the Opposition shows consistency in this case and supports the necessary measures we will take to ensure we have the best public service in the world.

There has been a well-orchestrated campaign in the last few weeks to convince people that decentralisation is at an end, with references by the Labour Party to phantom civil servants and so forth. Even last night, certain media headlines were claiming the programme had been abandoned. Like Mark Twain, the rumours of the demise of decentralisation were greatly exaggerated and the facts speak for themselves. To date, 2,500 people have already decentralised and progress will be made immediately with the decentralisation of another 3,500 people, making this by far the most ambitious decentralisation programme ever, with the headquarters of numerous Departments relocating to various parts of the country.

I recognise we have deferred the relocation of the final 4,000 posts for reconsideration in 2011. In the current circumstances, this was a wise decision. However, this should not detract from what has been achieved and the benefits it has brought to many communities around the country. It is interesting to note that one of the happiest campers in the Dáil yesterday evening was an Opposition Deputy who has seen at first hand the benefits of decentralisation, not too far from Deputy Devins’s part of the world. He said to me “Fair play — you are providing the jobs”, and I am.

If Fine Gael was in power, according to what its members say, it would abolish the whole public service.

Based on the realities, my Department could not have expected to receive the same money in 2009 as it received in 2008, and therefore, I had to make some difficult decisions. That was inevitable.

It is amazing how people forget the way it was in the past. When I came into the Department in 1997, the total capital allocation for the islands was €1 million. This year, despite a slight decrease, it is €25 million. In 2003, the budget of the Department was less than half of what it is today. There will not be as much money available next year and there will be a small reduction. However, when it is put in the context of how far we have gone so fast, I believe with careful management of the money we can achieve great benefits next year.

The rural development programme to be announced in the coming weeks will be the largest rural development programme ever and will involve an investment of €425 million. It will be almost three times the size of the programme which ran from 2000 to 2006. The programme will be rolled out between 2009 and 2013. Within this programme are major opportunities for people to develop rural areas and overcome some of the challenges they face at present.

As Minister, I will continue to focus on urban deprivation in which we face major challenges, some financial and some social. I will continue to make a major commitment in time and effort to the RAPID programme which is slowly but surely acquiring the confidence of the people in the communities affected. We will continue to roll out the programme as vigorously as ever.
