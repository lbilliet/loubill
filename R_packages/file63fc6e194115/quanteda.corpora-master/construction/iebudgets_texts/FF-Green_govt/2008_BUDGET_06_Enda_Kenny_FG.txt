This is a budget of no courage or vision and will not live up to the confidence expressed by the Government. It is important to put the budget in the political context in which it is framed. We have a Taoiseach who, by his own admission, is on the way out and will not be leading his party into the next election.

It is a while away yet.

It might not happen directly, but it is beginning to happen. There is also some rustling in the undergrowth from those who wish to contend against the anointed one. The Minister for Finance has had a favourable press for quite some time. If he was serious about being seen as the iron chancellor, I would have thought he would have measured up in his fourth budget to making some difficult decisions. He funked every difficult decision that faced him. No difficult decisions were taken and the easy option of borrowing €5 billion was taken to balance the books. Yesterday evening Deputy McGuinness said the public service was a shambles with the levels of service and efficiency 20 years behind where they should be. The Taoiseach’s comments this morning about a vision for the future, leadership, efficiency and world class standards revealed vastly contradictory elements within the Government. If the Minister for Finance were serious about setting out his charge of leading the Government half way through its tenure of office, or whenever, one might have expected that he would at least have taken the decisions that had to be made for the future. It is a budget without courage or vision and which will not inspire the [336] confidence set out as its hallmark, including in the Taoiseach’s speech.

The alarming consequence of the budget is that in the face of a modest slowdown in the economy the public finances have plunged precipitously, turning a €2.3 billion Exchequer surplus in 2006 into a €4.9 billion borrowing requirement next year. This will require at least €16 billion in borrowing over the next three years. The Taoiseach previously said we would eliminate borrowing and Government debt. This is the largest deterioration in the public finances in the history of the State, despite the comments by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. Can we believe their words anymore?

Yesterday the Minister for Finane blamed global economic conditions for the fiscal mess over which he presided. However, the public finances have been left dangerously exposed to a domestic property downturn due to his inability to be competent and face the difficult decisions, the Government’s mismanagement of the public finances and reckless cheerleading of an unsustainable and debt-driven housing boom.

Last month experts from the International Monetary Fund reported that no other economy was more vulnerable to a property downturn than this one. The international credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s estimated that the economy faced a prolonged slowdown, possibly to 2013, as the property bubble deflated. Even more worrying than the recent slowdown in property related tax receipts has been the Government’s longer term ratcheting up of public sector day-to-day spending without any consideration of value for money or public service reform. By urging on the property boom, Fianna Fáil generated a large tax bonanza for itself. This allowed it to increase spending dramatically, faster than economic growth without resorting to traditional tax sources to fund its extravagance.

Most commentators did not notice the tax and spend cuckoo that had crept into the nest. However, the end of the debt-fuelled property boom has shown it up in stark relief. For the last seven years Government spending has grown on average 40% faster than the economy. It has grown as a proportion of GNP from under 25% in 2000 to 31% today. Since the Minister for Finance took office he has presided over an acceleration rate of day-to-day spending growth of 10% in 2005, 11% in 2006 and 12% this year. So accustomed have pundits and commentators become to the Minister’s extravagance with taxpayers’ money that his promise to slow current spending growth to 8% next year, still 45% faster than the economic growth forecast, is presented as ambitiously prudent.

337

The budget is an opportunity to reflect on the Government’s overall allocation of taxpayers’ resources for the achievement of the country’s [337] economic, social and environmental objectives. Ireland’s most significant challenge stems from Ministers presiding over vital areas of the public sector with inflated budgets which are not delivering results on the front line. I listened to some comments from Ministers on the requirement to face the challenge of making decisions and delivering efficiency in the public sector, but there was no mention of this in the Budget Statement other than waffle and cotton wool. At the end of next year the situation will have deteriorated because this runaway horse is on the road and there is nothing in the budget to control it.

An unfortunate aspect of the budget and all of the Government’s previous budgets is that only the marginal tax and spending changes receive attention. There is almost no focus on the €39 billion in current spending allocated to Departments on an “existing level of service” basis. There is little focus on the €27 billion non-social welfare Government spending on day-to-day goods and services. There was the usual lazy assumption in the budget presentation that every euro spent by Departments offered value for money for the taxpayer and that the purpose of the budget was to allocate extra resources on top of historical spending patterns. That is a fundamental weakness in the Government’s capacity to deliver efficiency in the public service, not just this year but in the past seven years. The Government has turned its back on the opportunity for public sector reform and achieving real value in the public spend. It has spurned the process of budgetary scrutiny recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts. It allowed the culture of performance initiated in the 1997 Act to be stillborn. It failed to use benchmarking which will cost the taxpayer €14 billion in today’s money to leverage real reform. It is five years since I made the point in Killarney that if one was to pay benchmarking, one should build in targets, objectives and specifics for the delivery of efficiency in the public service. I was ridiculed for the cost of €1 billion per year for that benchmarking process. The attitude was pay the money and to hell with efficiency. As a result, we have a public service of greatly inferior quality than we should.

The Government has overseen the expansion of bureaucracy in the Health Service Executive. When one examines the titles of many of the higher administrators in the HSE and tries to figure out their roles, functions and responsibilities, it boggles the mind. The Government has outsourced its job to 178 new agencies, bringing the total at national level to over 630. This issue was raised by Deputy Varadkar when he spoke on the extent of quangos, the jobs they were supposed to do and the waste of public money involved in many of them.

338

The Government has overseen the high cost overruns on capital projects such as Luas and the [338] Dublin Port tunnel, now in situ and working well but at vastly inflated costs. As a result, the CSO estimates that the rate of inflation in public services has run at an annual average of 6% since 2000, 45% higher than the rate of cost inflation in the public sector in the United Kingdom. If cost inflation in the Irish public sector had been kept down at the UK rate, we would have had an extra €13 billion for tax reforms or front line services in education and health in the period 2000 to 2007, including an additional estimated €3.2 billion in 2007 alone. Mr. Gordon Brown’s Government in the United Kingdom insisted that public sector managers target and measure efficiency gains for every Department, delivering a total of €30 billion in efficiency gains between 2004 and 2007. This stands out as something that could have been done here. They are now targeting further efficiency gains of 3% per year by 2010-11, which will release an extra €42 billion for frontline services. In contrast, the Government here has never required Departments to measure or deliver specified efficiency gains. The reference in the efficiency review 2008 says each Department will be required to examine all administrative spending under its own or its State body’s aegis. What does that mean when there is no target inserted, no timeline and no specifics? If the Minister for Finance was serious about whipping public service efficiency out to the frontline of delivery, there would be efficiency targets and timelines which would be monitored and reported back to the Department of Finance on a monthly basis.

The measures identified should not jeopardise the maintenance of frontline services. So much more could have been provided for by way of frontline services had this been set out in a realistic, achievable and targeted manner.

In Britain they cut the number of administrative posts by almost 80,000, through technology-driven automation, with a high proportion of those posts being allocated to frontline services in education, health and policing. If the Irish Government had shown any semblance of a comparative level of ambition, there would now be 6,000 fewer administrative posts, with that capacity freed up for frontline services.

They introduced three-year budgets for all spending ministries to enable longer-term spending. UK ministries are given full end-year flexibility to carry forward any underspend from one year to the next so that wasteful year end splurges of money merely to get it spent are eliminated. Some areas in the Irish public sector, I understand, now receive cheques and payments for work they have not yet done, simply because agencies and elements of [339] Government Departments are unable to spend the money allocated to them in 2007. We have a situation where Irish public sector managers still face, in many cases, a “spend it or lose it” choice at the end of each year.

The British introduced a resource accounting and budgeting system to capture accurately the full running costs of public services, including the value of assets, and to sharpen management incentives. In contrast, Irish public sector managers still do not account for the value or use of the assets under their control. The British introduced systematic, transparent outcome focused performance management systems in the form of public service agreements between the UK Treasury and line spending ministries. In contrast here the Government has only this year introduced annual output statements by Departments, few of which contain any concrete target for efficiency or performance and are not linked to resource allocation in the budget.

In short, Fianna Fáil-led Governments, spoiled by the property taxes that amounted to phenomenal figures from the debt-driven housing boom, avoided the hard decisions and new approaches being taken by other governments. Instead they stuck to the soft option politics of throwing money at every public service problem. After ten years in office the Government now joins that solemn chorus calling for wage restraint and public sector reform. It has announced a new efficiency review, to be carried out in 2008. However, when it comes to its own interests, there is no demand for reform and efficiency, but rather enormous pay increases, equivalent to €600 a week, with no matching performance improvement, as against the €14 for the single mother in Sligo this morning who, when asked what she thought of that increase, said “big deal”.

Four new committees and three Ministers of State satisfied political demands in all the entourages. We can no longer afford these types of double standards and empty rhetoric about the need to achieve better value for money. Radical reform is not on the agenda of this Government. It just keeps doing the same thing, going back to the Taoiseach’s basic ethics, namely, to get in here and stay here. To have any credibility whatsoever, the new efficiency review has to start by suspending the big pay increases for Ministers and senior public sector managers, making them conditional on the performances and efficiencies delivered. I guarantee, in two months time, when price increases have come in again and the budget is long-forgotten, people will remember that this Government, at a weekend, embraced the recommendations for higher pay for Ministers and higher public servants without any reference to performance, efficiency, output or standards, while everybody else could pay the price.

340

[340] There is nothing in this budget for benchmarking. Obviously, that will kick in in 2009 and may well cost €300 million to €500 million — we do not know until the recommendations come out in January. The Minister for Finance should insist that every public body should independently deliver audited efficiency improvements of at least 2% during 2008. What is in his report is meaningless and there will be no increased efficiencies in the HSE or within any Government Department, given the way this is phrased. He should institute an immediate audit of every agency with the aim of achieving real far-reaching rationalisation. He should have held back €500 million, requiring bodies to bid for that new resource on the basis of delivering best practice at the frontline.

It would be childish not to welcome the improvements in pension and other social welfare benefit payments announced yesterday by Deputy Cowen, and indeed over successive budgets. Of course these measures are welcome. Even after the increases, however, one must reflect that the entire State pension for 2008 will still be less than one third of the pay increase now being accepted by the Taoiseach and Ministers. I look at the broken promises in this document as regards taxation, PRSI and all the rest, a point made by Deputy Reilly. We are now carrying out an audit, which I hope will be more accurate than the one conducted as regards the medical card for over-70s. The limit is now €184, so that a social welfare allocation of €197.80 could conceivably disqualify an applicant from receiving a medical card. Together with the charges now coming in, this means the Government has let down hundreds of thousands of people. The Government knew this was coming. Carrying out a blind ended audit is simply more waffle.

341

This budget is highly conservative when it comes to tax reform. Gone are the promises of PRSI reform and the promise to reduce the standard rate in 2008, which was in Fianna Fáil’s election manifesto. Gone is the top rate of tax promised by Deputy Cowen in his last budget. It is only a source of some amusement now that the one tax that was reformed yesterday was the measure the Minister for Finance had completely opposed. I witnessed his body language, words and aggression last May or June against this tax, and it was incredible. The Department of Finance never wanted anything to do with stamp duty. Whether the claims by the builders, who certainly got around Fianna Fáil last weekend, worked, they certainly have had their day, because the tax is being reformed. I cannot complain about that because Fine Gael, and indeed the Labour Party, had a very clear document about reform of stamp duty. That reform, however, was to be introduced at a time when confidence was still very high and it would not have waned like it has now. What [341] has happened is akin to a particular make of car that was imported 20 years ago, where there were problems with the petrol tank. The internal paint on those cars began to peel off if the level of petrol, or confidence, were to run low. When it did, elements of that paint got stuck in the filters. Even when the car was filled with petrol afterwards, it still never moved as it had originally.

Confidence has ebbed out of the property market. In a desperate move, where he was completely and utterly opposed previously, the Minister now introduces stamp duty reforms. While that will move some houses in terms of contracts being dealt with, it will not restore the level of confidence the Government had hoped for. In fact, when builders or developers are now faced with development charges, with the acquisition of land at more than €1 million per acre in some places, the cost for them of producing houses will be a figure below which they cannot sell.

People may feel stamp duty reform will bring major benefits, but I doubt it, given the international perspective and the uncertainty in banks with regard to interest rates and the ability to pay back mortgages. Serious issues surround first-time buyers getting on the property ladder. These issues include the cost of land and servicing land and the lack of real Government policy to provide for serviced land in sufficient quantities to reduce costs.

The point-blank refusal during the year of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to have anything to do with stamp duty reform now seems hypocritical in the extreme. This is the second time the Minister has been done down on this matter from his point of view. I believe this budget was changed over the weekend and there was no serious intent to reform stamp duty until the figures became perfectly obvious during the past ten days. Perhaps the big builders and developers got around the Government last weekend.

The promises made with regard to tax and PRSI were broken. Back are the stealth charges and charges which were a feature of tax policy in the previous administration. The threshold for the drugs repayment scheme increased by €5, accident and emergency unit and hospital charges increased by 10%, motor tax rose by 10% and the employee PRSI ceiling rose by €1,900. The budget failed to fully index income tax credits and bands against earnings. These are all direct stealth charges, particularly against the middle-income group which will now be forced to pay more. As well as dragging more workers into the top rate of tax, the effect of these stealth charges and taxes will be to increase the rate of inflation by 20% next year, putting further pressure on living standards for those on low incomes. It will also undermine national competitiveness.

342

I am concerned about the drop-off in the level of corporate taxes now available to the Govern[342] ment. I do not have the details of the figures so I do not know whether the increase in exports we experienced this year was due to expenditure on research and development available to international firms here but being spent abroad. When this detail becomes available it will be interesting to see why a fall-off occurred in the level of corporate tax paid in view of the fact that exports increased in 2007.

Seven years ago, the national climate change strategy committed to the reform of VRT and carbon levies to reduce Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions. For seven years, the Government did nothing about this while 500,000 new houses were built, in many cases in areas which meant people had to travel 50 miles, 60 miles or 70 miles to work, which led to 600,000 new cars on the road. There was a 55 minute delay on the road from the west this morning and it is like that every morning. The projections for car use by 2020 is that it will rise to approximately 3 million.

No consideration was given to emissions or commuter comfort and the Government locked Ireland into unsustainable energy uses for years to come. The Government has made no attempt to reach the Kyoto targets set for us. We now wonder why we must borrow large sums of money to pay our way out of the emissions commitments this country made under the Kyoto Protocol.

I welcome the changes in VRT. Why would I not do so? Fine Gael proposed these changes two years ago. The Government acts only when it is late and when the potential benefits of early action have long since been diluted. This happened with stamp duty and VRT reform.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is not here this morning. If he were serious about building a platform for this country’s future, why were difficult decisions left by the wayside in the budget? It is a soft option to borrow money, balance the books and keep it going as best one can. In recent weeks, the Government faced two motions of no confidence in the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children. This budget will not restore the level of confidence people need.

On 25 March at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis we were told taxes would be reduced, but Irish motorists woke up this morning knowing they were misled. The increase in motor tax represents a tax of €83 million that will hit every household and family. The spin from the Government is that this is part of a green agenda. It is not. It is a direct hit on the pockets of hard-pressed people who require motor transport to get to and from work. It will [343] hit the smallest economical vehicle to the largest gas-guzzler. It suits Fianna Fáil to use the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, as a cover for this raid, straightforward theft carried out by a Government wearing a green balaclava.

Yesterday, the Green Party became Fianna Fáil’s mudguard for this tax hike in the same way Fianna Fáil used the Progressive Democrats as its mudguard on health. The Green Party will now be used to protect Fianna Fáil from this blatant tax increase.

The cry will be to blame the Minister, Deputy Gormley. It is a green tax and that is why he is at it and he had to be given something. It will hit hundreds of thousands of people directly.

I mentioned the stealth taxes of the accident and emergency bed charges and the drug refund scheme, which represents a €50 million tax attack on the ill in society. It is strange that the Minister told us about the Kilbeggan bypass but not about the Government’s plans to take €50 million out of our pockets. That is what is left of the Progressive Democrats mudguard.

This issue of stamp duty reform typifies the desperation which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, felt in the run-in to this weekend. The Minister physically, verbally and politically opposed stamp duty every time it was mentioned. However, when the figures became clear, the big builders stated they were in the tent in Galway and the Minister had better do something about this on Wednesday. We now see the result.

I do not believe that reform at this time will restore the level of confidence in the housing market which people assume from construction elements or housing agencies. It is six months too late. Had it been done in the early summer when confidence was still at a high level it would not have stampeded the market but would have allowed it to move in a beneficial way.

This is a budget of no courage or vision and will not live up to the confidence expressed by the Government. It is important to put the budget in the political context in which it is framed. We have a Taoiseach who, by his own admission, is on the way out and will not be leading his party into the next election.

Yesterday evening Deputy McGuinness said the public service was a shambles with the levels of service and efficiency 20 years behind where they should be. The Taoiseach’s comments this morning about a vision for the future, leadership, efficiency and world class standards revealed vastly contradictory elements within the Government. If the Minister for Finance were serious about setting out his charge of leading the Government half way through its tenure of office, or whenever, one might have expected that he would at least have taken the decisions that had to be made for the future. It is a budget without courage or vision and which will not inspire the [336] confidence set out as its hallmark, including in the Taoiseach’s speech.

The alarming consequence of the budget is that in the face of a modest slowdown in the economy the public finances have plunged precipitously, turning a €2.3 billion Exchequer surplus in 2006 into a €4.9 billion borrowing requirement next year. This will require at least €16 billion in borrowing over the next three years. The Taoiseach previously said we would eliminate borrowing and Government debt. This is the largest deterioration in the public finances in the history of the State, despite the comments by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. Can we believe their words anymore?

Yesterday the Minister for Finane blamed global economic conditions for the fiscal mess over which he presided. However, the public finances have been left dangerously exposed to a domestic property downturn due to his inability to be competent and face the difficult decisions, the Government’s mismanagement of the public finances and reckless cheerleading of an unsustainable and debt-driven housing boom.

338

The Government has overseen the high cost overruns on capital projects such as Luas and the [338] Dublin Port tunnel, now in situ and working well but at vastly inflated costs. As a result, the CSO estimates that the rate of inflation in public services has run at an annual average of 6% since 2000, 45% higher than the rate of cost inflation in the public sector in the United Kingdom. If cost inflation in the Irish public sector had been kept down at the UK rate, we would have had an extra €13 billion for tax reforms or front line services in education and health in the period 2000 to 2007, including an additional estimated €3.2 billion in 2007 alone. Mr. Gordon Brown’s Government in the United Kingdom insisted that public sector managers target and measure efficiency gains for every Department, delivering a total of €30 billion in efficiency gains between 2004 and 2007. This stands out as something that could have been done here. They are now targeting further efficiency gains of 3% per year by 2010-11, which will release an extra €42 billion for frontline services. In contrast, the Government here has never required Departments to measure or deliver specified efficiency gains. The reference in the efficiency review 2008 says each Department will be required to examine all administrative spending under its own or its State body’s aegis. What does that mean when there is no target inserted, no timeline and no specifics? If the Minister for Finance was serious about whipping public service efficiency out to the frontline of delivery, there would be efficiency targets and timelines which would be monitored and reported back to the Department of Finance on a monthly basis.

The measures identified should not jeopardise the maintenance of frontline services. So much more could have been provided for by way of frontline services had this been set out in a realistic, achievable and targeted manner.

In Britain they cut the number of administrative posts by almost 80,000, through technology-driven automation, with a high proportion of those posts being allocated to frontline services in education, health and policing. If the Irish Government had shown any semblance of a comparative level of ambition, there would now be 6,000 fewer administrative posts, with that capacity freed up for frontline services.

They introduced three-year budgets for all spending ministries to enable longer-term spending. UK ministries are given full end-year flexibility to carry forward any underspend from one year to the next so that wasteful year end splurges of money merely to get it spent are eliminated. Some areas in the Irish public sector, I understand, now receive cheques and payments for work they have not yet done, simply because agencies and elements of [339] Government Departments are unable to spend the money allocated to them in 2007. We have a situation where Irish public sector managers still face, in many cases, a “spend it or lose it” choice at the end of each year.

The British introduced a resource accounting and budgeting system to capture accurately the full running costs of public services, including the value of assets, and to sharpen management incentives. In contrast, Irish public sector managers still do not account for the value or use of the assets under their control. The British introduced systematic, transparent outcome focused performance management systems in the form of public service agreements between the UK Treasury and line spending ministries. In contrast here the Government has only this year introduced annual output statements by Departments, few of which contain any concrete target for efficiency or performance and are not linked to resource allocation in the budget.

In short, Fianna Fáil-led Governments, spoiled by the property taxes that amounted to phenomenal figures from the debt-driven housing boom, avoided the hard decisions and new approaches being taken by other governments. Instead they stuck to the soft option politics of throwing money at every public service problem. After ten years in office the Government now joins that solemn chorus calling for wage restraint and public sector reform. It has announced a new efficiency review, to be carried out in 2008. However, when it comes to its own interests, there is no demand for reform and efficiency, but rather enormous pay increases, equivalent to €600 a week, with no matching performance improvement, as against the €14 for the single mother in Sligo this morning who, when asked what she thought of that increase, said “big deal”.

Four new committees and three Ministers of State satisfied political demands in all the entourages. We can no longer afford these types of double standards and empty rhetoric about the need to achieve better value for money. Radical reform is not on the agenda of this Government. It just keeps doing the same thing, going back to the Taoiseach’s basic ethics, namely, to get in here and stay here. To have any credibility whatsoever, the new efficiency review has to start by suspending the big pay increases for Ministers and senior public sector managers, making them conditional on the performances and efficiencies delivered. I guarantee, in two months time, when price increases have come in again and the budget is long-forgotten, people will remember that this Government, at a weekend, embraced the recommendations for higher pay for Ministers and higher public servants without any reference to performance, efficiency, output or standards, while everybody else could pay the price.

340

[340] There is nothing in this budget for benchmarking. Obviously, that will kick in in 2009 and may well cost €300 million to €500 million — we do not know until the recommendations come out in January. The Minister for Finance should insist that every public body should independently deliver audited efficiency improvements of at least 2% during 2008. What is in his report is meaningless and there will be no increased efficiencies in the HSE or within any Government Department, given the way this is phrased. He should institute an immediate audit of every agency with the aim of achieving real far-reaching rationalisation. He should have held back €500 million, requiring bodies to bid for that new resource on the basis of delivering best practice at the frontline.

It would be childish not to welcome the improvements in pension and other social welfare benefit payments announced yesterday by Deputy Cowen, and indeed over successive budgets. Of course these measures are welcome. Even after the increases, however, one must reflect that the entire State pension for 2008 will still be less than one third of the pay increase now being accepted by the Taoiseach and Ministers. I look at the broken promises in this document as regards taxation, PRSI and all the rest, a point made by Deputy Reilly. We are now carrying out an audit, which I hope will be more accurate than the one conducted as regards the medical card for over-70s. The limit is now €184, so that a social welfare allocation of €197.80 could conceivably disqualify an applicant from receiving a medical card. Together with the charges now coming in, this means the Government has let down hundreds of thousands of people. The Government knew this was coming. Carrying out a blind ended audit is simply more waffle.

341

This budget is highly conservative when it comes to tax reform. Gone are the promises of PRSI reform and the promise to reduce the standard rate in 2008, which was in Fianna Fáil’s election manifesto. Gone is the top rate of tax promised by Deputy Cowen in his last budget. It is only a source of some amusement now that the one tax that was reformed yesterday was the measure the Minister for Finance had completely opposed. I witnessed his body language, words and aggression last May or June against this tax, and it was incredible. The Department of Finance never wanted anything to do with stamp duty. Whether the claims by the builders, who certainly got around Fianna Fáil last weekend, worked, they certainly have had their day, because the tax is being reformed. I cannot complain about that because Fine Gael, and indeed the Labour Party, had a very clear document about reform of stamp duty. That reform, however, was to be introduced at a time when confidence was still very high and it would not have waned like it has now. What [341] has happened is akin to a particular make of car that was imported 20 years ago, where there were problems with the petrol tank. The internal paint on those cars began to peel off if the level of petrol, or confidence, were to run low. When it did, elements of that paint got stuck in the filters. Even when the car was filled with petrol afterwards, it still never moved as it had originally.

Confidence has ebbed out of the property market. In a desperate move, where he was completely and utterly opposed previously, the Minister now introduces stamp duty reforms. While that will move some houses in terms of contracts being dealt with, it will not restore the level of confidence the Government had hoped for. In fact, when builders or developers are now faced with development charges, with the acquisition of land at more than €1 million per acre in some places, the cost for them of producing houses will be a figure below which they cannot sell.

People may feel stamp duty reform will bring major benefits, but I doubt it, given the international perspective and the uncertainty in banks with regard to interest rates and the ability to pay back mortgages. Serious issues surround first-time buyers getting on the property ladder. These issues include the cost of land and servicing land and the lack of real Government policy to provide for serviced land in sufficient quantities to reduce costs.

The point-blank refusal during the year of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to have anything to do with stamp duty reform now seems hypocritical in the extreme. This is the second time the Minister has been done down on this matter from his point of view. I believe this budget was changed over the weekend and there was no serious intent to reform stamp duty until the figures became perfectly obvious during the past ten days. Perhaps the big builders and developers got around the Government last weekend.

The promises made with regard to tax and PRSI were broken. Back are the stealth charges and charges which were a feature of tax policy in the previous administration. The threshold for the drugs repayment scheme increased by €5, accident and emergency unit and hospital charges increased by 10%, motor tax rose by 10% and the employee PRSI ceiling rose by €1,900. The budget failed to fully index income tax credits and bands against earnings. These are all direct stealth charges, particularly against the middle-income group which will now be forced to pay more. As well as dragging more workers into the top rate of tax, the effect of these stealth charges and taxes will be to increase the rate of inflation by 20% next year, putting further pressure on living standards for those on low incomes. It will also undermine national competitiveness.

I am concerned about the drop-off in the level of corporate taxes now available to the Govern[342] ment. I do not have the details of the figures so I do not know whether the increase in exports we experienced this year was due to expenditure on research and development available to international firms here but being spent abroad. When this detail becomes available it will be interesting to see why a fall-off occurred in the level of corporate tax paid in view of the fact that exports increased in 2007.

Seven years ago, the national climate change strategy committed to the reform of VRT and carbon levies to reduce Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions. For seven years, the Government did nothing about this while 500,000 new houses were built, in many cases in areas which meant people had to travel 50 miles, 60 miles or 70 miles to work, which led to 600,000 new cars on the road. There was a 55 minute delay on the road from the west this morning and it is like that every morning. The projections for car use by 2020 is that it will rise to approximately 3 million.

No consideration was given to emissions or commuter comfort and the Government locked Ireland into unsustainable energy uses for years to come. The Government has made no attempt to reach the Kyoto targets set for us. We now wonder why we must borrow large sums of money to pay our way out of the emissions commitments this country made under the Kyoto Protocol.

I welcome the changes in VRT. Why would I not do so? Fine Gael proposed these changes two years ago. The Government acts only when it is late and when the potential benefits of early action have long since been diluted. This happened with stamp duty and VRT reform.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is not here this morning. If he were serious about building a platform for this country’s future, why were difficult decisions left by the wayside in the budget? It is a soft option to borrow money, balance the books and keep it going as best one can. In recent weeks, the Government faced two motions of no confidence in the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children. This budget will not restore the level of confidence people need.

On 25 March at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis we were told taxes would be reduced, but Irish motorists woke up this morning knowing they were misled. The increase in motor tax represents a tax of €83 million that will hit every household and family. The spin from the Government is that this is part of a green agenda. It is not. It is a direct hit on the pockets of hard-pressed people who require motor transport to get to and from work. It will [343] hit the smallest economical vehicle to the largest gas-guzzler. It suits Fianna Fáil to use the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, as a cover for this raid, straightforward theft carried out by a Government wearing a green balaclava.

Yesterday, the Green Party became Fianna Fáil’s mudguard for this tax hike in the same way Fianna Fáil used the Progressive Democrats as its mudguard on health. The Green Party will now be used to protect Fianna Fáil from this blatant tax increase.

The cry will be to blame the Minister, Deputy Gormley. It is a green tax and that is why he is at it and he had to be given something. It will hit hundreds of thousands of people directly.

I mentioned the stealth taxes of the accident and emergency bed charges and the drug refund scheme, which represents a €50 million tax attack on the ill in society. It is strange that the Minister told us about the Kilbeggan bypass but not about the Government’s plans to take €50 million out of our pockets. That is what is left of the Progressive Democrats mudguard.

This issue of stamp duty reform typifies the desperation which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, felt in the run-in to this weekend. The Minister physically, verbally and politically opposed stamp duty every time it was mentioned. However, when the figures became clear, the big builders stated they were in the tent in Galway and the Minister had better do something about this on Wednesday. We now see the result.

I do not believe that reform at this time will restore the level of confidence in the housing market which people assume from construction elements or housing agencies. It is six months too late. Had it been done in the early summer when confidence was still at a high level it would not have stampeded the market but would have allowed it to move in a beneficial way.

>>>>>>> FETCH_HEAD
It is a dull, uninspiring and unimaginative budget from a Minister who is happier to take the easy option than make the difficult decisions. Ordinary families and small businesses will pay for the incompetency and mismanagement of Fianna Fáil running this economy. Whether we have the same Taoiseach this time next year, when we stand in the House we will find the chickens will have come home to roost from this budget. It is a dull, uninspiring and unimaginative budget that lacks courage and [344] vision, and from that perspective it leaves a lot to be desired.
